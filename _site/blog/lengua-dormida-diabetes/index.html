<p>Lengua Dormida Diabetes: Understanding the Connection</p>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to various complications if left uncontrolled. One lesser-known complication of diabetes is a condition called &quot;lengua dormida,&quot; which translates to &quot;sleeping tongue&quot; in English.</p>
<p>Lengua dormida is a term used to describe a tingling or numb sensation in the tongue. It can also be accompanied by a burning or itching sensation. While it may seem like a minor inconvenience, it is essential to understand the connection between lengua dormida and diabetes.</p>
<p>The tingling or numbness in the tongue is often a result of nerve damage, a common complication of diabetes known as diabetic neuropathy. High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves throughout the body, including those responsible for the sense of touch in the tongue. This damage can lead to abnormal sensations, such as tingling or numbness.</p>
<p>If you experience lengua dormida, it is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider, as it may be a sign that your diabetes is not well-controlled. Your doctor may recommend adjustments to your diabetes management plan, such as changes in medication or lifestyle modifications.</p>
<p>In addition to managing your blood sugar levels, there are other steps you can take to alleviate lengua dormida. Maintaining good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing, can help prevent infections that may worsen the symptoms. Avoiding tobacco and alcohol can also help reduce nerve damage.</p>
<p>In conclusion, lengua dormida is a lesser-known complication of diabetes that can be a result of nerve damage. If you experience tingling or numbness in your tongue, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider to ensure your diabetes is well-controlled. By managing your blood sugar levels and practicing good oral hygiene, you can alleviate the symptoms and prevent further complications.</p>
