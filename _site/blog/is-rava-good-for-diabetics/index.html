       Is Rava Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>?</p>
<p>Rava or semolina is a staple ingredient for many Indian dishes, ranging from upma, halwa to biryani. It is often thought of as a healthier alternative to refined white flour as it is made from whole-wheat grains. Many people wonder if rava is good for diabetics, and fortunately the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Firstly, rava is low in glycemic index. Glycemic Index or GI gives us an idea of how quickly a food increases blood sugar levels. The higher the GI level, the higher the risk of developing diabetes and other related complications. Rava has a low GI of 44 which is much lower than white rice and wheat flour. This means it releases energy slowly, which will help keep your blood sugar in check.</p>
<p>Experts also suggest eating whole grains, like rava, on a regular basis to benefit from their high fibre content. Having adequate dietary fibre can help slow down the rate of digestion, helping to reduce the peak blood glucose levels. Reducing the peak glucose levels can help prevent possible long-term complications related to diabetes.</p>
<p>Each 100 grams of rava is also packed with various vitamins and minerals such as magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and iron. It also contains a good amount of dietary fibre and protein. All of these nutrients serve to benefit diabetics in their long-term management of the disorder.</p>
<p>Apart from being low in glycemic index and packed with beneficial nutrients, rava is also relatively low in calories. A single serving of rava upma comprises of only 130 calories. This makes it a great choice for diabetics who are trying to maintain an optimal weight.</p>
<p>Finally, being low in carbohydrates, rava helps to reduce calorie intake for those looking to keep their carbohydrate consumption in check. This further helps in reducing the risk of diabetic complications.</p>
<p>In conclusion, rava is definitely a great choice for diabetics looking for a healthy alternative to regular white flour. Not only it is low in glycemic index, but it also packs a variety of beneficial vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. On top of that, it is relatively low in calories and carbohydrates. All in all, rava is a good alternative for diabetics who are watching their diet.</p>
