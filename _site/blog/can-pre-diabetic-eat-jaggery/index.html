       Can Pre Diabetic Eat Jaggery
    </h1>
<p>Jaggery, also known as ‘gur' is a traditional sweetener made of sugarcane or date palm. It is available in a solid block form and is used in many Indian sweet dishes like laddoos, barfis, etc. Consumed with moderation, jaggery is said to have several health benefits. So, the burning question is – can pre-diabetics eat jaggery?</p>
<p>Let us first understand the concept of pre-diabetes. It is a condition wherein the blood glucose level of a person is higher than normal, but is yet not high enough to be termed as diabetes. If left untreated, pre-diabetes may lead to diabetes.</p>
<p>Now to answer, if a person suffering from pre-diabetes can consume jaggery, the answer lies in moderation. Jaggery is a sweet substance made of sugarcane juice that is heated for several hours and then solidified. It is much healthier than refined sugar and contains minerals and vitamins. It also has a lower glycemic index than white sugar (50-65 compared to 65-68). This means that jaggery releases glucose at a slower rate than refined sugar.</p>
<p>However, it is recommended that pre-diabetics always keep an eye on all their sugar intakes, including the ones from jaggery. They should try to limit their jaggery intakes or switch to fruit sweeteners such as dates, raisins, and figs. This is because jaggery still contains the sugar content and a pre-diabetic person should try to cut back on sugar consumption instantly to avoid the risk of diabetes.</p>
<p>In addition to this, jaggery can also help in controlling pre-diabetes in a few ways. Firstly, jaggery helps in producing enough digestive juices to digest food properly which in turn prevents the accumulation of carbs in the body. Secondly, Jaggery is rich in minerals and vitamins which helps in strengthening the metabolic system and making it less prone to diseases like diabetes. Last but not the least, jaggery also is known to be a natural cleanser. This further helps in reducing the risk of pre-diabetes.</p>
<p>Having said that, it always best to consult a doctor before consuming jaggery if you are suffering from pre-diabetes. They will gauge the intensity of your condition and suggest the best diet plan to keep diabetes at bay.</p>
<p>To conclude, jaggery can be consumed by pre-diabetics but in moderation. Eating too much jaggery can increase the risk of diabetes or further worsen the existing condition. Consulting your doctor and following a proper diet and exercise plan is recommended for pre-diabetics.</p>
