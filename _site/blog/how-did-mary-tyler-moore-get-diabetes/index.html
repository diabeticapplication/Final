       How Did Mary Tyler Moore Get Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Mary Tyler Moore was a beloved American actress, best known for her roles in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show.&quot; However, behind her successful career, she battled a chronic illness that greatly impacted her life - diabetes.</p>
<p>Mary Tyler Moore was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 33. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This results in the inability to produce insulin, a hormone necessary for regulating blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is still unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is thought that certain genes make individuals more susceptible to the disease, and an environmental trigger, such as a viral infection, may initiate the autoimmune response.</p>
<p>Moore was open about her struggles with diabetes and became an advocate for diabetes research and awareness. She co-founded the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) in 1970, which has since become a leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes research.</p>
<p>Living with diabetes requires constant monitoring of blood sugar levels, insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump, and careful management of diet and exercise. Moore faced these challenges head-on and became an inspiration for many others living with the disease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite her efforts, Moore's health continued to decline over the years. She experienced various complications related to diabetes, including vision problems and kidney failure. In 2017, she passed away at the age of 80 due to cardiopulmonary arrest, which was a result of pneumonia, but her diabetes certainly played a role in her declining health.</p>
<p>Mary Tyler Moore's journey with diabetes serves as a reminder of the importance of raising awareness and supporting research for this chronic illness. Her advocacy work and determination to live a fulfilling life despite her health challenges continue to inspire and educate others about the realities of living with diabetes.</p>
