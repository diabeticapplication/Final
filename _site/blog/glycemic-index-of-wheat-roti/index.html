A high glycemic index indicates that the carbohydrates present in wheat roti are quickly broken down and absorbed in the body, leading to a sudden increase in the blood sugar levels. High glycemic index foods like wheat roti should be consumed in moderation to maintain the desired health. It is advised to combine wheat roti with proteins and good fats to slow down the digestion process and lower its glycemic index. Additionally, consuming wheat roti with more fiber-rich ingredients like pulses or vegetables can also help reduce its glycemic index.</p>
<p>When it comes to glycemic index value, wheat roti is not the healthiest food option. Generally, the glycemic index of roti is around 70 which means it is a high glycemic index food.

Moreover, foods with a low glycemic index helps in managing blood sugar levels and are also great for weight management. Therefore, it is recommended to choose healthier food options over wheat roti to maintain good health.</p>
