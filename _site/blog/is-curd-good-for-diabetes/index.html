       Is Curd Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Living with diabetes can be a challenge as it requires careful planning of meal times and food intake. This is why it is important to make sure every dish you eat is healthy and satisfies your nutrition needs while controlling your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>A regular diet for diabetes must include a balanced blend of nutrients, carbohydrates, fats, protein, minerals and vitamins. Curd or yogurt is a healthful addition to a diabetes-friendly diet, having a significant amount of protein, calcium, vitamin B1 and B2, carbohydrate and potassium.</p>
<p>Curd is a great source of probiotics which helps in decreasing glucose levels and improving insulin secretion. Probiotics also have other health benefits including improving digestion, strengthening immunity and helping build a strong digestive system.</p>
<p>The protein in curd can be beneficial for people with diabetes, as it helps keep blood sugar levels stable and helps in weight management. A cup of curd contains 18 gm of protein, which makes it a perfect snack if you want to stay fuller for longer.</p>
<p>Since diabetes puts a person at risk for heart and kidney diseases, it is essential to make sure you choose a heart-healthy curd. Whole-milk curd can be avoided and instead, low-fat or fat-free yogurts can be consumed. It is advised to look for yogurts that are added with probiotics and have lower carbs and calories.</p>
<p>It is advised that diabetics should serve themselves with plain, unsweetened curd and make healthy recipes with it. To reap its maximum benefits, try mixing it with nutrient-rich fruits, nuts or seeds, which can be found in diabetic friendly snacks.</p>
<p>To conclude, curd can be a very beneficial food item for people with diabetes. Low-fat or fat-free yogurts are best for diabetics and they should also ensure that the probiotic content of the yogurt is sufficient and that they choose unsweetened, plain yogurt instead of sweet variations. Eating this yogurt snack in moderation should help to keep your sugar levels in check.</p>
