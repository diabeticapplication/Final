<ol>
<li>
<p>Carrot sticks: Carrots are low in carbs and high in fiber, making them a great snack for diabetic dogs. They are also packed with vitamins and minerals that can benefit their overall health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green beans: Another low carb option, green beans are a crunchy and nutritious treat for diabetic dogs. They are high in fiber and low in calories, making them a great choice for weight management as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blueberries: These tiny fruits are not only low in carbs but also rich in antioxidants, which can help boost your dog's immune system. They are a sweet and tasty treat that your diabetic dog will love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pumpkin: Pumpkin is a great source of fiber and can help regulate your dog's digestion. It is also low in carbs and can be served as a puree or baked into treats.</p>
