       Can Ayurveda Cure Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Ayurveda is a traditional system of Indian medicine which can be dated back many thousands of years. Traditionally, Ayurveda believes in the individualised treatment of the disease, taking into account patient’s specific condition and lifestyle. While modern medicine mainly looks at diabetes as a “cut and dry” condition, Ayurveda seeks to treat diabetes from the individual's unique perspective.</p>
<p>Although research into Ayurveda and diabetes is still in its infancy, there are some promising evidence which suggests that Ayurveda’s holistic approach to treating diabetes offers potential advantages over modern medicine. Several animal studies have indicated that certain Ayurvedic herbs like shilajit, guduchi, arjuna and turmeric are beneficial for treating diabetes, while human studies are still awaited.</p>
<p>Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes incorporates certain lifestyle changes as well as herbal and mineral remedies. Here are a few ways Ayurveda can help in treating diabetes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Positive lifestyle changes: Ayurveda believes that diabetes is a result of incorrect lifestyle practices like overeating, unhealthy eating patterns, lack of exercise, etc. Ayurveda recommends lifestyle changes such as making healthy dietary choices, having light, easily digestible meals, and regular exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Herbal Remedies: Ayurvedic herbal remedies have been used for centuries to help control diabetes. Between them, many herbs have anti-hyperglycemic and anti-diabetic properties. Commonly used herbs are fenugreek, bitter melon, holy basil, turmeric and neem. Also, some herbs like shilajit and Arjuna have been linked to improving blood sugar levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mineral-based remedies: Minerals like chromium, magnesium and zinc are known to help lower the levels of blood sugar. Chromium is an essential mineral that helps the body use insulin efficiently, thus reducing the risk of getting diabetes. Ayurveda recommends including mineral-rich foods in the diet to help control diabetes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body purification: Ayurveda recommends Panchakarma treatment as a means of cleansing the body of toxins and promoting health. The treatment comprises of a series of five cleansing techniques which helps get rid of wastes and toxins from the body and restore natural balance. Panchakarma is known to be beneficial for diabetes, as it not only helps to detoxify the body and activates metabolic processes, but also strengthens the digestive system and increases the efficiency of digestion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, research into Ayurveda and diabetes is still limited due to the complexity of the subject. However, the basic notion that certain lifestyle changes, herbs and minerals can help control diabetes, is accepted by both modern science and Ayurveda. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ayurveda does possess potential for treating diabetes, although it is still not</p>
