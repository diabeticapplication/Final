       Is Diabetes Contagious
    </h1>
<p>When it comes to diabetes one of the most common questions that people tend to ask is whether the condition can be spread from one person to another – in other words, is diabetes contagious? Unfortunately, diabetes is not contagious and thus cannot be spread from person to person. Let’s take a look at why this is the case and answer some common questions about diabetes and transmission.</p>
<p>The vast majority of cases of diabetes – type 1 and type 2 – are caused by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise and being overweight. Therefore, unlike, say, a cold or flu which is caused by a virus, diabetes cannot be passed on from one person to another. In other words, you cannot “catch” diabetes by being in contact with someone who has the condition.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is no need to worry when sharing items such as pens and pencils with someone who has diabetes. Again, because the condition is not caused by a virus, it is not possible to catch diabetes by coming into contact with something that they have used recently.</p>
<p>That said, there is one type of diabetes – gestational diabetes – that can in fact be passed on from a mother to her baby. The medical term for this is congenital diabetes. In such cases, the mother’s hormones interfere with the way the baby’s body produces insulin, leading to an increased series of sugar in the blood – in other words, diabetes. However, this type of diabetes is not contagious – that is to say it does not spread between members of the public.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, diabetes is not contagious. However, this doesn’t mean that you can ignore the fact that it is an extremely serious health condition. Diabetes can have a significant effect on a person’s health and cause complications if it is not properly managed. If you are diagnosed with diabetes then it is essential that you make lifestyle changes and take any medication that is prescribed to you.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although diabetes is very serious and has significant effects on a person’s health, we can be sure that it is not contagious. It is therefore safe to be in contact with those who have the condition – you just need to be aware of the importance of making the necessary lifestyle changes and taking the right medication if you have diabetes.</p>
