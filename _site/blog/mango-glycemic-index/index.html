       Mango Glycemic Index
    </h1>
<p>Mangoes have a high glycemic index of over 60, which means they have a large impact on blood sugar levels. Eating a lot of mangoes can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels which may result in diabetes, obesity, and other health problems. People with diabetes should be particularly cautious when consuming mangoes - they should eat them in moderation and combine them with other foods that are lower on the glycemic index scale. Eating mangoes with some healthy fats and proteins can help to reduce the glycemic index of the mango and reduce the impact on blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables is the best way to ensure a balanced diet.     Mangos have a higher glycemic index than the average food, ranging from 43 to 55. The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly a food item will raise a person's blood sugar levels. Foods with a high glycemic index are digested quickly and can cause a spike in blood sugar. In comparison, foods with a lower glycemic index take longer to digest and provide a steady release of energy over a longer period of time. While mangos are a healthy fruit that contain essential vitamins and minerals, people with diabetes should be mindful of their glycemic index when including them in their diets. Consuming too many high glycemic index fruits can cause an unexpected rise in blood sugar levels which can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Yes, diabetics can eat mango, as long as it is consumed in moderation and as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Mangoes have a higher glycemic index than many other fruits, and therefore, it is important for people with diabetes to monitor their portion size. As a general rule, it is recommended that diabetics limit their daily intake of high-glycemic foods to no more than three servings. Additionally, it is important for diabetics to pair their mango intake with sources of dietary fiber, fat, and protein, such as nuts, avocados, or a low-fat yogurt, to help slow the absorption of the fruit’s natural sugars. Eating mango can be a delicious and nutritious part of a diabetes-friendly diet, but it is important to be mindful of portion size and combine it with other healthy foods.</p>
