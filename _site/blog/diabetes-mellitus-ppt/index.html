<p>Diabetes Mellitus Ppt: Understanding the Silent Epidemic</p>
<p>Diabetes Mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. In this blog, we will explore the various aspects of diabetes mellitus and its impact on individuals and society.</p>
<p>To begin with, let's understand the different types of diabetes. There are three main types: Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This type of diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Type 2 diabetes is the most common form, accounting for around 90% of all diabetes cases. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, sedentary behavior, and poor dietary choices. It can be managed through lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and sometimes insulin therapy.</p>
<p>Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. It is crucial to monitor blood sugar levels during pregnancy to ensure the health of both the mother and the baby.</p>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of the types of diabetes, let's delve into the impact it has on individuals and society. Diabetes is often referred to as a silent epidemic because its symptoms can be subtle or even absent in the early stages. However, if left untreated or poorly managed, it can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputations.</p>
<p>The economic burden of diabetes is staggering. According to the International Diabetes Federation, diabetes-related healthcare costs accounted for $760 billion globally in 2019. This includes direct medical expenses, such as hospitalizations and medications, as well as indirect costs like loss of productivity and disability. The financial burden of diabetes affects individuals, families, and healthcare systems, making it a significant public health concern.</p>
<p>Prevention and early detection play a crucial role in combating diabetes. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy weight, can significantly reduce the</p>
