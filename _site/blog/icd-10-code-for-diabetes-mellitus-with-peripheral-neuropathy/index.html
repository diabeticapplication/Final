       Icd 10 Code For Diabetes Mellitus With Peripheral Neuropathy
    </h1>
<p>Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. One of the complications that can arise from diabetes is peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves in the extremities, such as the hands and feet.</p>
<p>When it comes to coding for diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy, the ICD-10 code that is used is E11.40. This code specifically refers to Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified. It is important to note that there are different codes for different types of diabetes and different types of neuropathy, so it is crucial to accurately document and code the specific condition.</p>
<p>Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of individuals with the disease. It can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain in the affected areas. In severe cases, it can lead to loss of sensation and even ulcers or infections.</p>
<p>Proper coding for diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy is essential for accurate medical billing and reimbursement. It also helps in tracking the prevalence and incidence of these conditions, which can aid in research and public health efforts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ICD-10 code for diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy is E11.40. This code is used to accurately document and code this common complication of diabetes. Proper coding is crucial for accurate medical billing and reimbursement, as well as for tracking the prevalence and incidence of these conditions. If you or someone you know has diabetes and is experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, it is important to seek medical attention and ensure that the condition is properly documented and coded.</p>
