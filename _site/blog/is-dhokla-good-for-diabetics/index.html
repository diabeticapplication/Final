       Is Dhokla Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>Everyone loves this savoury Gujarati snack called dhokla, but the question arises, whether dhokla is good for people with diabetes? Dhokla is traditionally made with besan/chickpea flour, which is high in fibre as well as carbohydrates- two things that diabetics need to be aware of and manage their consumption of. However, when making dhokla it is important to consider not only the ingredients used but also the overall impact of the dish on an individual's diet.</p>
<p>When considering the question if dhokla is good for people with diabetes, we must understand the different components of the dish that could affect blood sugar levels. dhokla is made with high fibre carbohydrates like Besan, rice, ragi or various other flours. Fiber is important as it helps to slow down the digestion of food, preventing the blood sugar levels from rising too quickly. The fermentation process also helps to break down the carbohydrates and higher fibre contents, which can help to reduce the Glycaemic Index (GI) of the dhokla and reduce the risk of sudden spikes and drops in blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>When making dhokla for diabetics, one should consider substituting some of the flours with ingredients that are low in GI such as oats, almond or coconut flours. Furthermore, it is also important to adjust the amount of sugar used in the recipe, as sugar can affect blood glucose levels. Adding low GI ingredients, such as dates and jaggery instead of sugar, will help to minimise the rise in blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>When it comes to condiments and garnish that are usually added to dhokla, it is important to use ingredients that are low in calories and sugar. The use of spices, such as turmeric, methi, cumin and ginger, can also help to reduce the GI of the dhokla.</p>
<p>In conclusion, dhokla can be a great snack option for people with diabetes, as long as the ingredients are selected carefully. Be mindful of the GI and sugar content of the ingredients used and ensure that the dhokla is made with low GI flours. Furthermore, adjusting the amount of sugar used, substituting it with low GI sweeteners and adding spices can all help to reduce the effect of the dhokla on blood sugar levels.</p>
