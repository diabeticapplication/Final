These nutrients are important for helping with diabetes because they help to regulate insulin levels.

<p>Pumpkin seeds also contain an antioxidant called alpha-tocopherol. This antioxidant helps to protect the body from oxidative damage which can lead to numerous health problems. This antioxidant may help protect people with diabetes from cardiovascular issues and could also reduce the risk of stroke and other diabetes-related complications.</p>
