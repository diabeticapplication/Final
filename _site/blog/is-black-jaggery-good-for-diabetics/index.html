       Is Black Jaggery Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>One of the most popular questions asked by diabetics is whether black jaggery is a suitable food for diabetics or not. Although diabetes varies from person to person, some people believe that black jaggery can help control diabetes if taken in moderation. However, before deciding to consume it regularly, it's important to understand what black jaggery is, its nutritional value and its impact on diabetes.</p>
<p>Black jaggery is unrefined and solidified sugar obtained from sugarcane. It is rich in vitamins and minerals, including iron, magnesium, selenium, phosphorous and calcium. Unlike white sugar, black jaggery retains the natural molasses content of the sugarcane and hence has a richer flavour and darker color. However, despite its nutritional value, it does contain a high level of sugar content at about 90g of sugar per 100g.</p>
<p>The American Diabetes Association suggests that maintaining a healthy weight and controlling blood sugar levels should be the first step when managing diabetes. Consumption of refined sugar, such as white sugar, is not recommended as it is high in calories and can lead to rapid rises in blood glucose. Therefore, many experts believe that black jaggery could be beneficial in helping to maintain normal blood glucose levels, as its sugar content is absorbed by the body slower than that of white sugar.</p>
<p>In addition, black jaggery aids in digestion, boosts immunity and improves the quality of the blood. It may also be beneficial in reducing the symptoms of anemia, as it is high in iron content.</p>
<p>All these benefits can be easily attained if black jaggery is taken in a controlled amount. A teaspoon of it taken after meals is usually enough. Diabetics should avoid consuming jaggery in excessive quantity, as it will lead to a sharp rise in the blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>In conclusion, black jaggery can be a beneficial food for diabetics. However, it is important to remember that moderation is key. Consuming it in controlled quantities will help in maintaining normal blood glucose levels and it will also give you the energy boost you need.</p>
