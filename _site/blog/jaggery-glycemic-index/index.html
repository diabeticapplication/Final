       Jaggery Glycemic Index
    </h1>
<p>Jaggery is a widely consumed unrefined sugar, made from sugarcane or date palm. It is believed to have a low glycemic index (GI), meaning it is digested and absorbed slowly, preventing sudden spikes in blood sugar levels. It is a rich source of minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, which are beneficial for overall health. Jaggery also contains antioxidants, which can be beneficial for the immune system. It has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to treat various ailments, including constipation, indigestion, and anemia. While the exact glycemic index of jaggery is not known, its low GI is thought to be beneficial for diabetes management.</p>
<p>Jaggery is a natural sweetener made from sugar cane juice. It has a glycemic index (GI) of 65, which is lower than that of most other alternative sweeteners. Table sugar has a GI of 68, whereas honey has a GI of 55. Jaggery is also high in essential minerals such as iron, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, which makes it a healthier sweetener compared to refined sugar, which contains no nutritional value. Additionally, jaggery does not cause any sudden spikes in blood sugar levels, which makes it a better choice for people with diabetes. Thus, jaggery can be a healthier alternative to table sugar and honey as it has a lower GI and provides essential minerals.</p>
<p>Here are the top 5 food items that can be prepared with jaggery to keep diabetes in check: Kheer, Coconut Barfi, Chikki, Halwa, and Sweet Potato Halwa. Kheer is a traditional Indian pudding made of milk, rice and jaggery. Coconut Barfi is a delicious sweet made with coconut, jaggery and ghee. Chikki is a traditional treat made with jaggery and peanuts. Halwa is a popular dessert made with jaggery, flour, and ghee, while Sweet Potato Halwa is a variation made with jaggery and sweet potatoes. All of these dishes can be enjoyed by diabetics with no worries.</p>
