       How Many Diabetic Patients Recovered From Covid-19
    </h1>
<p>As the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, questions have risen among diabetic patients and their families about what will happen if they get infected.</p>
<p>The good news is that, while diabetic patients are at a slightly higher risk of developing more severe symptoms from the virus, a large majority of them can recover from the illness. According to a study done by the Endocrine Society, among the 305 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who contracted COVID-19, 74 percent of them had no symptoms and were able to recover without any medical intervention.</p>
<p>However, there are still certain precautions which diabetic patients, especially those with severe complications related to the condition, must take to ensure a safe recovery. First, it’s important to maintain a strict blood sugar control regimen. This includes frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels and adjusting insulin doses accordingly. Diet and exercise must also be properly managed, as both can help to minimize the risk and severity of any virus-related complications.</p>
<p>Diabetic patients should also contact their doctors if they experience any symptoms related to COVID-19, such as fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. In this situation, the doctor can advise the patient on the best course of action and coordinate any necessary medical treatment.</p>
<p>When it comes to any other necessary medical treatment, diabetics should be sure to stay up to date on the latest information. As the situation evolves, the medical community is increasing its focus on the health of diabetic patients both during and after recovery from COVID-19. For instance, research suggests that diabetic patients may be at an increased risk for long-term health complications. As such, it’s important to stay informed and take any necessary additional precautions to ensure long-term health.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while diabetic patients are at an increased risk for developing more severe symptoms from the virus, a large majority of them will be able to recover without any medical intervention. However, diabetic patients should take all possible precautions to ensure a safe recovery. These include monitoring and managing blood sugar levels, managing diet and exercise, staying up to date on the latest information and treatments, and seeking medical attention if any COVID-19 symptoms develop.</p>
