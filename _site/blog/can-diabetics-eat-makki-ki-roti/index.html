       Can Diabetics Eat Makki Ki Roti
    </h1>
<p>Makki ki roti is one of the most popular dishes in Indian cuisine. It is a flatbread made from maize flour, also known as cornmeal. The dish is served with a variety of accompaniments, such as curries, dals, and vegetables. Makki ki roti is a highly nutritious and delicious dish that is enjoyed by people of all ages. But if you have diabetes, you may be wondering if you can eat makki ki roti without putting your health at risk.</p>
<p>The good news is that diabetics can enjoy makki ki roti in moderation. This is because it is rich in fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar by slowing down digestion. Eating makki ki roti also increases the feeling of fullness, helping to weather cravings and reduce the chances of overeating.</p>
<p>However, people with diabetes should practice moderation and eat it in controlled amounts. Makki ki roti is low in fat and saturated fat, but it has a higher glycemic index (GI), which means that it can cause a spike in blood sugar levels. The higher the GI, the faster the blood sugar spike.</p>
<p>On the GI scale, makki ki roti is classified as a high GI food. However, it does not mean that diabetics should avoid it altogether. By practising moderation, diabetics can still enjoy the dish without increasing their risk of health complications.</p>
<p>Some tips to keep in mind when having makki ki roti if you are diabetic include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pair it with low glycemic index foods: to minimize the impact on blood sugar levels, diabetics should pair makki ki roti with low GI foods to help regulate the bodyâ€™s response to carbs. Good dietary companions to makki ki roti include veggies, legumes, and lean proteins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have it early in the day: to minimize the effect of carbs on blood sugar, diabetics should have makki ki roti early in the day so that the body has sufficient time to digest the food and maintain a balanced blood sugar level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay attention to portion size: eating makki ki roti in large amounts can cause a spike in blood sugar levels, so diabetics should be mindful of their portion size and limit their intake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add vegetables: adding vegetables to the dish can help reduce the GI, increasing its nutrition value and making it a better choice for diabetics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, diabetics can enjoy makki ki roti in moderation. However, they should be mindful of their portion size, glycemic index, and the foods they pair it with. Doing so can help them enjoy the dish without compromising their health.</p>
