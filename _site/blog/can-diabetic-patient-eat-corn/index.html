       Can Diabetic Patient Eat Corn
    </h1>
<p>People who are suffering from diabetes are often under the impression that they have to forgo certain foods from their diet. Eating corn is usually on the same list of restricted foods. But, this is not always the case. Corn can still be enjoyed as part of a healthy, balanced diet for those with diabetes.</p>
<p>Most people with diabetes are aware of the importance of a balanced diet and understand which foods they can and cannot eat. All forms of corn, whether canned, frozen or dried, are considered as starchy carbohydrates. This means corn should be eaten in moderation as part of a well-balanced diabetes diet.</p>
<p>Corn is high in carbohydrates but also contains some beneficial nutrients. It is an excellent source of dietary fiber, vitamin A, folic acid, and potassium. It is also a good source of B vitamins and minerals such as Copper, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron. Eating corn in moderation can help you to meet your nutrient needs and provide health benefits.</p>
<p>The glycemic index of corn depends on whether it is cooked or uncooked, and the type of corn. The glycemic index measures how quickly and how much the foods you eat increases your blood sugar levels. A high glycemic index food gets absorbed into the body quicker than a low one. Cooked yellow corn is known to be lower on the glycemic index than other varieties.</p>
<p>When it comes to people with diabetes, the type of corn that they are eating and how it is cooked should be taken into consideration. Eating smaller servings and controlling portion sizes can help to minimize the rise in blood sugar levels. Fibre can also help with blood glucose control, so adding some extra fibre can also be beneficial.</p>
<p>Those with diabetes should also look at other dietary habits such as eating frequently throughout the day to help manage blood sugar levels. Choose foods that are low in calories, saturated fats and trans fat and eat multiple servings of vegetables, fruits and lean proteins at each meal.</p>
<p>In summary, those with diabetes can still enjoy eating corn as part of a balanced diet. Itâ€™s important to keep portion sizes modest, choose lower glycemic index variety and focus on other dietary habits in order to maintain a healthy blood sugar level.</p>
