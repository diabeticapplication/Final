       Can Diabetics Eat Chikoo
    </h1>
<p>The pleasure of eating chikoo also called sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) is a universal favorite across cultures. But with diabetes, the enjoyment of eating chikoo can give many people pause. Many people arenâ€™t sure if they can enjoy chikoo without putting their health at risk. The simple answer is yes, diabetics can eat chikoo in moderation.</p>
<p>Chikoo is a healthy source of dietary fiber. The sweet, starchy fruit is a good source of complex carbohydrates and can be included in a low-carb, healthy diet when eaten in moderation. Chikoo is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamins C, A, and B-6, calcium, iron, and magnesium.</p>
<p>Despite its healthful properties, diabetics should still practice moderation when consuming chikoo. The fruit is rich in natural sugar, so diabetics should be mindful of their overall sugar intake. A good rule of thumb is to limit sugar from all sources to 30-35 grams per day, and to stick by the recommended portion size for chikoo. For diabetics, a single serving of chikoo should approximately 8-15 grams of carbohydrates, depending on the type.</p>
<p>Chikoo can be enjoyed in various ways. Replace unhealthy desserts with whole or sliced fresh chikoo, or make smoothies or purees out of the fruit. You can also add chikoo to salads or oatmeal for extra vitamins and flavor.</p>
<p>In addition to fructose, chikoo also contains anthocyanins- a type of flavonoids that has antioxidant properties. These flavonoids can reduce cell damage and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes-related complications.</p>
<p>Try to get organically grown chikoo to enjoy the full range of health benefits. As for any other fruit or food item, diabetics should consult their doctor about healthful servings and enjoy the food in moderation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, chikoo can be an enjoyable part of a diabetic diet. With moderation and careful portioning in mind, diabetics can enjoy the sweet taste of chikoo and all of its health benefits.</p>
