       Is Horlicks Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>Horlicks has always been a popular health drink throughout India and across the world. It is advertised as a nutritious and comforting bedtime drink. But is it really suitable for people with diabetes?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is complicated – as it depends on the type and severity of your diabetes, as well as your dietary choices.</p>
<p>Horlicks is high in carbohydrates, which can affect blood sugar levels if consumed in excess. Generally, people with diabetes are advised to limit their carbohydrate intake to 25-35% of their daily energy intake and to choose carbohydrates that are high in fibre and low in added sugars.</p>
<p>When it comes to sugar, Horlicks contains 30.1g of sugar per 100g. This is quite high for a nutrition drink, and is a big concern for those with diabetes who need to watch their sugar intake.</p>
<p>Not all is lost, as the good news is that Horlicks is a great source of vitamins and minerals. It contains calcium, niacin, vitamin B12, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc. All of these can be helpful in managing diabetes, as they provide essential nutrients to support a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>But the best way to get your daily vitamins and minerals is through a balanced diet. Consuming Horlicks as a replacement for food is not recommended and can leave you feeling sluggish and potentially raise your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that Horlicks contains several unhealthy ingredients like hydrogenated oil, skimmed milk powder, and modified starch. All of these are linked to increasing the risk of diabetes and other health complications such as weight gain.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is to always check the nutritional label when purchasing Horlicks, so you can make sure it is suitable for your diabetes needs. If you find a low-sugar and healthy version of this drink, then Horlicks can provide you with essential vitamins and minerals that can help manage your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Overall, while Horlicks can be a helpful source of certain vitamins and minerals, it is important to be aware of the sugar and unhealthy ingredients present in the drink. Be sure to look for low-sugar versions, or opt for healthier alternatives such as homemade health drinks like green smoothies or chia seed drinks. And rule of the thumb – always check with your doctor or nutritionist before including any new food or drink in your diet.</p>
