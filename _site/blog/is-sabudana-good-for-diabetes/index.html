       Is Sabudana Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Sabudana, also referred to as tapioca pearls, is a popular snack in India and some parts of Southeast Asia. It is made from the starchy root of the cassava plant. Since sabudana is high in carbohydrates and has a glycemic index (GI) of 95, many believe it is not suitable for people with diabetes.</p>
<p>However, recent research suggests that sabudana consumption may actually be of some benefit to people with diabetes. One study found that consuming 25g of sabudana for breakfast during Ramadan encouraged a lower post-meal spike in blood sugar levels than a more traditional meal. Similarly, a separate study found that despite its high GI, sabudana consumption did not result in any significant post-meal glycemic responses.</p>
<p>These positive findings start to make sense when we consider how sabudana is typically consumed. Traditional methods of preparing sabudana involve combining it with low GI foods, such as peanuts, and soaking it overnight. Soaking it for a longer period allows the starch content to break down into more complex starches which are digested more slowly. It also helps to reduce the glycemic index of the sabudana meal.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s more, sabudana is naturally low in fat, with just 0.2g per cup cooked, and contains minimal calories, so it can help to reduce your overall calorie intake. It also offers a good source of dietary fiber, particularly when combined with other low GI foods, helping you to feel fuller for longer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, sabudana used in traditional ways appears to be beneficial for people with diabetes. Although it contains a high amount of carbohydrates, it can be combined with low GI foods allowing for more gradual digestion and absorption. Plus, it contains minimal calories, and a good source of dietary fiber, which can help to support stable blood sugar levels and enhance feelings of satiety. Just make sure you adjust your insulin dosages or carb intake to reflect the sabudana in your diet, so you can benefit from its nutritional advantages without disrupting your glycemic control.</p>
