<p>Furthermore, black-eyed peas have a low glycemic index, meaning they have a minimal impact on blood sugar levels. This makes them an ideal food choice for diabetics as they can be included in meals without causing significant fluctuations in blood sugar.</p>
<p>There are various ways to incorporate black-eyed peas into your diet. They can be added to soups, stews, salads, or even made into a delicious dip. So, whether you are a diabetic or not, black-eyed peas are a nutritious and versatile food that can benefit everyone.</p>
