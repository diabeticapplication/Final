       Can Diabetics Eat Raw Mango
    </h1>
<p>Mangoes are one of the most beloved summertime fruits. It's no wonder, given that they are sweet and juicy, vibrant in color, and, as a bonus, hold numerous health benefits. But can diabetics eat mangoes?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but portion control and added sugar must always be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>As an anti-oxidant, mango offers diabetics a host of health benefits. It’s not only an excellent source of dietary fiber and vitamins, but also contains healthy amounts of anti-diabetic properties like magnesium, potassium, and vitamin C. Furthermore, mango also offers formulators plenty of pectin, an extract from fruits and vegetables that helps to inhibit the absorption of glucose and reduce bad cholesterol. In other words, mango can reduce the risk of diabetic complications.</p>
<p>When considering if a person with diabetes can eat mango, it’s important to understand the two different types - raw and ripe. Unripe mango is sugar free and contains much higher amounts of fiber, making it a great way for anyone to incorporate the fruit into their diet. Ripe mango, however, contains about 16-25g of sugar per 100g portion. While this is not considered a large amount, it must still be taken into account - especially for those with diabetes.</p>
<p>To enjoy ripe mango without risking the associated sugar spike, it is best to eat it in small quantities. For example, a serving size of about 40g or one-third of a medium-sized fruit is enough for diabetics. Moreover, this should be eaten as part of a balanced meal to help keep a steady blood sugar level.</p>
<p>Another option for those with diabetes to enjoy the benefits of mango is to eat it as part of something else. For instance, adding it to smoothies, salads, or desserts can offer a very exciting addition to any meal, filled with health-promoting properties and good flavor.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s important to keep track of the glycemic index of mango. It usually falls into the low to medium range, so it should be fine even for those with diabetes. It is always best to consult a doctor or nutritionist to decide how much is safe to eat.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mango is a great fruit for people with diabetes to enjoy, as long as it is eaten in control. Eating too much ripe mango, for example, might cause blood sugar levels to spike, so be sure to pay attention to portion size and the glycemic index. Raw mango is probably the best option for those with diabetes as it has much higher levels of dietary fiber and low levels of sugar. Finally, adding mango to smoothies, salads, or desserts is a safe and enjoyable way to have some fun in the kitchen and reap the health benefits of this beloved summertime fruit.</p>
