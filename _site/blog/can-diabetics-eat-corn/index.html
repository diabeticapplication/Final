       Can Diabetics Eat Corn
    </h1>
<p>In short, yes, diabetics can eat corn – depending on how they are preparing it.</p>
<p>Corn is not widely known as being especially beneficial for diabetics, but it can still be a nutritious and necessary part of a healthy diabetic diet. For those affected with diabetes, it is important to understand the ways that corn can be used in small amounts within a strict diabetic diet.</p>
<p>Firstly, corn is a great source of dietary fiber, which helps to slow the absorption of sugar in the body. This is particularly helpful to keep blood sugar levels on track. Fiber is beneficial in many other ways as well, such as helping promote digestion and the reduction of cholesterol.</p>
<p>Corn is also a great source of vitamin C, which helps to protect the cells from oxidative stress. Studies have found that those with diabetes can benefit from adding vitamin C to their diet. This is especially true if the person has neuropathy or other damage due to long-term diabetes.</p>
<p>Corn is low in fat, which makes it an excellent choice for diabetics. It’s also an excellent source of protein, which is helpful in maintaining muscle mass.</p>
<p>But before you reach for that corn-on-the-cob or can of sweet corn, there’s something to keep in mind: corn can have a big impact on blood sugar levels. It’s important to prepare corn correctly, while also including it in moderation.</p>
<p>For those with diabetes, roasting or grilling corn is great – so long as you don’t add too much sodium or sugar. Cornbread contains simple carbs, so it should be consumed with caution.</p>
<p>Most canned corn varieties will have added sugar or sodium, so concentrate there in small amounts – such as half a cup at a time. Niblets, creamed corn, and corn cakes are all off-limits for those with diabetes, as they are all high in sugar and carbs.</p>
<p>To get the most health benefits out of corn, opt for fresh or frozen ears of corn on the cob. It’s important to pay attention to portion size, however, as it still can contain high amounts of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Corn also contains phytic acid, which can reduce the absorption of calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium - so it is important to also consume other foods that contain these minerals in order to absorb them.</p>
<p>Overall, diabetics can still enjoy corn, just be sure to watch your portion size and select the correct varieties. Those with diabetes should speak with a registered dietician to learn more about how to incorporate corn in their diet.</p>
