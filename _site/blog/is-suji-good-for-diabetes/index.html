       Is Suji Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>When it comes to diabetes, all foods should be eaten in moderation. Suji, or semolina also known as rava or sooji, is no exception. However, many diabetics may assume that suji isnâ€™t suitable for them, thinking it to be high in sugar and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Suji, like many cereal-grains, is a great source of carbohydrates to include in a balanced diet. It is comprised of complex carbohydrates with very little added sugar. It is also rich in both protein and fibre, with the fact that it is low in fat being of great benefit. With its natural slow-burn carbohydrate source it can act to release energy more slowly into the body, thus helping to maintain healthier levels of blood glucose.</p>
<p>For such a small cereal-grain, suji is surprisingly high in essential nutrients. Most notably it is high in phosphorus which is essential for healthy and functioning cell membranes. Iron, folic acid, beta-carotene, thiamine and riboflavin are also notable nutrients present in suji.</p>
<p>The real benefit to suji comes in its glycemic index (GI). GI is a measure of how quickly a particular food enters the bloodstream as glucose and affects blood sugar levels. On a scale of 0-100, suji has a relatively low GI rating of approximately 70. This means that suji enters the bloodstream slowly, and should not cause spikes in blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>This does not mean however, that suji can be eaten freely by diabetics. Suji is still high in carbohydrates, with each tablespoon containing 4.5g of carbohydrates. To maintain proper blood sugar levels it is important that diabetics maintain a healthy and balanced diet, rather than focusing on individual foods. This applies to all diabetics, regardless of the GI rating or nutrient composition of certain foods.</p>
<p>When eating suji it is essential that the food is prepared appropriately. Simply frying it in oil or butter may cancel out any of the health benefits or low GI rating, and should be avoided. Suji may be better enjoyed by using low fat, low calorie replacements for these ingredients such as steaming, baking or simply boiling.</p>
<p>To conclude, while all diabetics should strive to maintain a balanced and healthy diet, suji can still be included. If eaten in moderation and prepared without added oils or butters, suji can be a great source of complex carbohydrates and essential nutrients. It should be noted however, that due to its high carbohydrate content, it is still unwise for diabetics to over-consume suji.</p>
