       Is Jaggery Better Than Sugar For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>Jaggery and sugar are the two sweeteners found in the kitchen of most Indians. Both are integral parts of our daily lives, yet one is a natural sweetener while the other is artificial. As diabetics, it is important to know which sweetener is better for us and what benefits and drawbacks each one has.</p>
<p>To start with, when it comes to sugar, it is obviously something that diabetics should stay away from, as it is likely to increase and amplify diabetes-related problems. It contains nothing but pure, refined sucrose, making it a source of quick energy and a large amount of liquid calories. On the other hand, jaggery is made from sugarcane juice, which has been heated and concentrated. It is then processed by adding certain ingredients to it. As a result, jaggery is a much better option for diabetics than sugar, as it is considered a healthier sweetener and also contains several nutrients such as minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.</p>
<p>Although the glycemic index of jaggery is the same as that of sugar, studies have shown that jaggery can increase insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This indicates that, taken in moderation, it can help manage diabetes and its symptoms by controlling blood sugar levels. Furthermore, jaggery also helps keep your digestive system healthy and even fight constipation.</p>
<p>Another plus point associated with jaggery is that it has fewer calories than sugar and is a great source of energy. This means that those with diabetes can enjoy a sweet yet healthy snack without worrying about gaining extra weight. In addition, jaggery also has many medicinal properties which can help those suffering from diabetes. It is known to keep the liver healthy and boost immunity.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that both jaggery and sugar should be consumed in moderation and one should not go overboard. Excess consumption of either could pose a risk to health and should be avoided. Moreover, it is important to consult with a doctor before making any drastic changes in your diet.</p>
<p>In conclusion, jaggery is a much better option for diabetics than sugar owing to its nutritional benefits. While it is true that jaggery may contain the same amount of sugar as sugar, its healthier components help in controlling diabetes-related issues such as insulin sensitivity and blood sugar levels. However, one should still remember to consult their doctor before replacing sugar with jaggery.</p>
