       Can Diabetics Eat Papaya
    </h1>
<p>If you're a diabetic, you may be wondering if papaya is a viable option for maintaining blood sugar levels. After all, you don't want to start adding food items to your diet that will cause them to fluctuate. Fortunately, papayas are a great item for diabetics to include in their diet, as they are low in calories, free of cholesterol, and packed with nutrients.</p>
<p>First off, let's look at the nutrition facts of papaya. One serving is equal to just 1/2 cup of cubed papaya and contains only 22 calories. It's also very rich in dietary fiber, which is essential for helping maintain a healthy digestive system. Papayas are also high in vitamin C, vitamin A, and potassium as well as various B-vitamins. All of these are important when it comes to managing and maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes papaya great for diabetics is its ability to help regulate insulin levels. It has a natural glycemic index of 40, making it a low-glycemic food. This means that it can help to regulate blood sugar spikes. Eating papaya pre- and post-meal can also help to control fluctuations in blood sugar.</p>
<p>The natural enzymes papain and chymopapain found in the fruit, helps to break down fat and carbohydrates and even aid digestion. This means that your body is better able to metabolize foods, which can prevent excess insulin production and avoid severe blood sugar fluctuations.</p>
<p>Papaya is also a great food choice for diabetics as it's packed with minerals and vitamins, but doesn't contain any sugar, which is important for those with diabetes. In addition, the antioxidants found in papaya can help protect your body from the effects of free radicals in the environment, which can prevent complications of type-2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Papaya is a very manageable food choice for diabetics, and can be a great way to encourage healthy eating habits. You can easily add it to a variety of dishes, such as smoothies, salads, and soups, and get the benefits of its high nutrient content. Additionally, try to choose papaya that is dark in color and feel it should be slightly soft but still firm.</p>
<p>Overall, with the correct amount of papaya, one can maintain healthy blood sugar levels and enjoy the many benefits. Eating just a half cup of cubed papaya can provide you all the essential vitamins and minerals you need with very few calories. As such, it's definitely a viable option for those with diabetes looking to add some variety to their diet.</p>
