       Why Are Some Patients Of Diabetes Treated With Insulin
    </h1>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disorder which affects people of all ages and occurs due to a lack of insulin production by the pancreas or a lack of response to insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone essential for regulating blood sugar levels in the body. Therefore, for patients with diabetes, insulin injections or pumps must be provided to help the body process glucose.</p>
<p>There are two main types of diabetes; Type I and Type II. Type I diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency in the body. In this situation, the pancreas is unable to produce any insulin, leaving the body unable to process glucose. For this reason, Type I diabetic patients require lifelong insulin to regulate their blood sugar.</p>
<p>Type II diabetes on the other hand, is usually diagnosed in adults and can arise due to a relative insulin deficiency or due to a lack of response to insulin (insulin resistance). In some cases, patients may need to be treated with insulin due to their pancreas’s inability to produce enough insulin or due to the body’s lack of response to the hormone.</p>
<p>Insulin injections are the only way to artificially manage diabetes and provide glucose to the cells, necessary for energy. Insulin also helps to reduce the glucose levels produced by the liver and keeps the blood sugar balance in check. It helps to control the amount of sugar in the blood which, if left unchecked, can cause severe complications to the body such as kidney damage, nerve damage, vision loss, cardiovascular disease etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, insulin treatment is essential for diabetic patients who are unable to produce enough insulin of their own or who are unable to process it due to insulin resistance. It is the only way to regulate glucose and keep diabetes under control. In addition, some diabetic patients may experience bursts of high blood sugar levels, known as hyperglycemia, and a doctor may prescribe insulin in order to prevent this condition.</p>
<p>Insulin replacement therapy can be as simple as just one shot per day to daily pumps over the course of the day. Some patients require multiple injections per day, or an insulin pump that provides a continuous flow of insulin over the day. It is important to discuss the type of insulin delivery, as well as the type of insulin, with a doctor before commencing treatment to ensure that it is the best option for the patient.</p>
<p>In conclusion, insulin therapy is essential for diabetic patients and, in many cases, it is the only way to regulate blood sugar levels and keep diabetes under control. If you think that you may require insulin treatment for diabetes, it is essential that you discuss this with your doctor.</p>
