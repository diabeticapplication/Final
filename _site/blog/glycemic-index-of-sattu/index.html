       Glycemic Index Of Sattu
    </h1>
<p>Sattu is a traditional Indian food that has gained popularity in recent years due to its numerous health benefits. It is made by grinding roasted Bengal gram (chickpeas) into a fine powder. Sattu is not only delicious but also highly nutritious, making it a great addition to any diet. One important aspect of sattu that is often overlooked is its glycemic index.</p>
<p>The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels. Foods with a high GI are rapidly digested and absorbed, causing a spike in blood sugar levels. On the other hand, foods with a low GI are digested and absorbed more slowly, resulting in a gradual rise in blood sugar levels.
