<p>In addition to providing a wide range of food options, the Mastering Diabetes Food List also encourages portion control and mindful eating. This means paying attention to hunger and fullness cues, eating slowly, and savoring each bite. By practicing mindful eating, individuals can better manage their blood sugar levels and prevent overeating.</p>
