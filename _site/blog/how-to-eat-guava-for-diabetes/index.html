       How To Eat Guava For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>If you have diabetes, you will know the joy that comes with finding delicious snacks that you can enjoy without compromising your health. Guava is a great choice and one many diabetics may overlook. Guava is full of essential vitamins and antioxidants, dietary fibre, and lots of other nutrition. It can help to lower your blood sugar and is a great way to add variety to your diabetes diet.</p>
<p>One of the best things about guava is that it is low in calories and low on the glycaemic index (GI). The GI looks at how carbohydrates affect your blood sugar levels, with low GI foods having less affect on your blood sugar than high GI foods. Guava has a GI of only 15, making it a great sweet treat for those with diabetes looking to maintain stable blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>When it comes to eating guava for diabetes, there are a number of ways to enjoy it. You can opt for fresh guava, either straight from the fruit or in a smoothie. You can also opt for guava nectar or juice. If you’re looking for something sweeter, you can opt for a guava-based pudding or cake.</p>
<p>If you’re choosing fresh guava, make sure to pick ones that are ripe. Unripe ones will be sour and hard. To check if a guava is ripe, look for ones that are deep red or yellow. They should be firm, but not hard, and slightly soft to the touch.</p>
<p>When preparing fresh guava for diabetics, you need to take care to limit any sugars that may be added. This means avoiding added syrup or sweeteners. If you plan on adding guava to a smoothie, be sure to use fresh fruit rather than juice. Adding milk is fine, however, as it helps to add protein and nutrient content to your drink.</p>
<p>When eating guava for diabetes, it’s also important to keep portions in mind. A portion size for those with diabetes should be no more than 1-2 pieces, with a maximum of 100g per day. This helps to control your portions as well as your blood sugar.</p>
<p>In addition to helping to keep your blood sugar levels in check, eating guava for diabetes can also help to control your weight. Guava is full of fibre and helps to make you feel fuller for longer. Eating guava for diabetes can also help to add some much needed variety to your diet.</p>
<p>Though guava is a great alternative to traditional sweet treats, it is important to keep in mind that diabetes requires careful management. Eating guava should only be part of an overall balanced diet and exercise plan. Along with eating guava, make sure to include plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits, lean proteins, and whole-grain carbohydrates. This will help ensure that you are getting the nutrition you need to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
