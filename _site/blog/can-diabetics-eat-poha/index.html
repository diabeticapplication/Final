       Can Diabetics Eat Poha
    </h1>
<p>Poha is one of the most loved dishes of India, especially during breakfast. It makes the mornings even more special as it is tasty, nutritious, and light. Amongst all these benefits, one query that comes to mind as far as diabetics are concerned is - can diabetics eat poha?</p>
<p>The good news is, yes! Diabetics don't need to miss out on an opportunity to relish this tasty snack. However, they may need to tweak the recipe slightly.</p>
<p>The main ingredient in poha is flattened rice; also known as beaten, flattened or flattened rice. It is a form of paddy or rice that has been flattened, so that various shapes, sizes, textures and thicknesses are created. This type of rice is high in carbohydrates but also makes for a great option since it is devoid of toxins and is a whole grain.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have revealed that eating a whole grain such as flattened rice is beneficial for diabetics. This is because whole grains are slowly digested, so the carbohydrates are released in the body at a slow and steady pace. This helps to maintain a consistent blood sugar level.</p>
<p>Another great benefit of this type of rice is that it provides a good amount of dietary fibre. Fibre is known to help lower cholesterol, and prevent heart disease and other medical conditions which are commonly associated with diabetes. It also helps to reduce the risk of obesity, and therefore diabetes itself.</p>
<p>Of course, diabetics still have to be careful about how much poha they consume. The total carb content of poha is the same as regular rice, so if too much is eaten, it can increase the sugar level in the blood. Therefore it is important to pay attention to portion size.</p>
<p>For diabetics, it is advisable to make poha using whole grain poha (available in many stores today) instead of the usual poha flakes available in supermarkets. The whole grain poha is a much healthier option and can help keep sugar levels in check.</p>
<p>Apart from that, adding vegetables, legumes, nuts, and other healthy ingredients such as low-fat yogurt and milk to the poha is a great way to make it more nutrition-friendly. These ingredients will also provide more fibre, proteins, and essential vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>Also, it's advisable for diabetics to avoid adding too much sugar to their poha. This includes sugar, jaggery, honey, and any other sweeteners. Substitute these with sweet spices such as cinnamon or cardamom, or other herbs such as mint or coriander.</p>
<p>To conclude, poha is a great snack option for diabetics if it is made with whole grain poha and is consumed in moderate quantities. Adding healthy ingredients to the poha such as vegetables, legumes, nuts and low-fat milk will</p>
