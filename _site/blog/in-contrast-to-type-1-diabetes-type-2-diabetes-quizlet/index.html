       In Contrast To Type 1 Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes Quizlet
    </h1>
<p>In contrast to Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose). It is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for about 90-95% of all diagnosed cases. Unlike Type 1 Diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, Type 2 Diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin production.</p>
<p>Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels. In Type 2 Diabetes, the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin, meaning that the cells do not respond properly to insulin's signals to take up glucose from the bloodstream. As a result, blood sugar levels rise, leading to a condition called hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>Type 2 Diabetes is often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, sedentary behavior, and poor diet. It typically develops in adulthood, although it is increasingly being diagnosed in children and adolescents due to the rise in childhood obesity rates. Family history and genetics also play a role in the development of Type 2 Diabetes.</p>
<p>Unlike Type 1 Diabetes, which requires lifelong insulin therapy, Type 2 Diabetes can often be managed through lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, weight loss, and medication if necessary. However, if left untreated or poorly managed, Type 2 Diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and nerve damage.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes are chronic conditions that affect the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, they differ in their underlying causes and treatment approaches. Understanding the differences between the two types of diabetes is crucial for effective management and prevention strategies.</p>
