       Is Idli Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes glucose, or sugar. People with diabetes must be mindful of what they eat to ensure their blood sugar levels remain within the recommended range. One of the most commonly asked questions among those with diabetes is whether or not idli is a good choice for a meal.</p>
<p>Idli has long been considered a go-to dish for many South Indians, and for those with diabetes, it can potentially be a good option to include in the diet. Idlis are made from fermented rice and split lentils, and are typically served with chutney or a vegetable curry. This combination provides complex carbohydrates, fiber and protein.</p>
<p>The rice used to make idlis is usually boiled, milled, and then partially cooked, which has a low glycaemic index (GI), and is digested slowly by the body. This helps to keep blood sugar levels stable, which is important for people with diabetes. The lentils in the idli also add additional protein, fiber, and antioxidants, which can also help with blood sugar control.</p>
<p>Additionally, idlis are steamed, not fried, and donâ€™t contain trans fats, so they are an excellent source of healthier carbohydrates when compared to other deep fried snacks. When served with coconut chutney or other vegetable curry, you're also adding in the benefits of healthy fats and other nutrients.</p>
<p>While these factors all point towards idli being an acceptable dish to include in a diabetic diet, it is important to note that serving size remains critical for managing your blood sugar levels. Eating too much of any carbohydrate-rich food, including idli, can increase your blood sugar levels. Generally for those with diabetes, it is recommended to enjoy small portions or even half portions of idli if you need to stay mindful of your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>All in all, idlis can be a good option for those with diabetes, however, it is important to be mindful of portion sizes, and specific ingredients when making the dish. Idli served with healthier accompaniments, such as vegetable curry or coconut chutney, can be a nutritious, low-GI dish great for keeping blood sugar levels in check.</p>
