       Are Cherries Good For Diabetics

<p>Cherries are a popular summertime snack that have many benefits, especially for those with diabetes. Cherries are a low glycemic index (GI) food, meaning they raise the levels of glucose in the blood slowly and steadily. How certain foods raise the levels of glucose in the blood can be important for diabetics. This is because more rapid increases in glucose levels can cause spikes in the levels of insulin, which can lead to some of the negative health effects of diabetes. Cherries also have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce the inflammation that can be a symptom of diabetes.</p>
<p>Further studies have suggested that cherries may also act as an insulin resistance reducer. Insulin resistance is when the body has difficulty processing glucose in the blood, resulting in higher than normal glucose levels. This can be because the cells are not responding to the insulin effectively. Eating cherries has been linked to an improvement in the ability of the cells to respond to insulin, leading to a decrease in glucose levels.</p>
<p>The antioxidants found in cherries may also be beneficial for those with diabetes. Antioxidants protect the body from free radicals which can cause cell damage. Oxidative stress and antioxidants can both affect diabetes symptoms. With diabetes, the body has an increased production of free radicals which can increase cell damage and cellular dysfunction. Antioxidants provide protection against this damage.</p>
<p>Cherries also contain many other beneficial nutrients. Some of these include fiber and potassium, two nutrients which can help in proper blood sugar management. Fiber slows the rate of absorption of glucose from food into the bloodstream. It also feeds the healthy bacteria in the gut which can help to further regulate glucose levels. Potassium can also help to control blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although cherries may provide some benefits, diabetes is a serious condition and should always be managed under the care of a physician. It is important to take the proper medications and follow a healthy diet and exercise plan to effectively manage the severity of diabetes. Additionally, all “diabetic friendly” foods should be moderated in order to maintain optimum health.</p>
<p>Overall, cherries can be a great snack for those with diabetes. As long as they are part of a well-balanced diet, they can provide many health benefits. The antioxidants, fiber, and low glycemic index make them an excellent choice for those with diabetes. So if you're looking for a tasty snack, why not try adding some cherries to your diet!</p>
