       Can Diabetic Patient Eat Sugarcane
    </h1>
<p>If you have diabetes, you may wonder if it’s safe to eat sugarcane. After all, it’s a sweet, starchy food that may spike your blood sugar levels. The good news is that eating sugarcane in moderation won’t have a major impact on your blood sugar levels and may even offer some benefits.</p>
<p>Sugarcane is a type of sweet grass with juicy, fibrous stalks. It’s an excellent source of carbohydrates, which can raise your blood sugar levels. A 120-gram stalk of sugarcane contains about 19 grams of carbs.</p>
<p>In general, it’s best to limit your carb intake when you have diabetes. That said, the carbohydrate content of sugarcane is low compared with other carbohydrates. In addition, some of the carbohydrates found in sugarcane are a type called oligosaccharides. These aren’t absorbed by the body in the same way that other carbs are and may not raise your blood sugar levels as much.</p>
<p>Sugarcane also contains some fiber. This nutrient can partially slow down the absorption of carbohydrates and help prevent a large spike in blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Eating sugarcane can also provide you with several key vitamins and minerals. A 120-gram stalk provides about 120% of the DV for vitamin C, 8% of the DV for calcium, and 4% of the DV for iron.</p>
<p>Sugarcane juice may be especially beneficial for people with diabetes. Some research has shown that taking sugarcane juice extract before meals may help reduce the rise in blood sugar levels that usually occurs after eating. It’s unclear how long this benefit may last and if taking the extract is effective for managing long-term blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of sugarcane, it’s best to consume it in moderation if you have diabetes. This means that you should avoid drinking large amounts of sugarcane juice and limit your consumption of the stalks themselves.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s important to keep in mind that sugarcane is high in sugar. The average 120-gram stalk contains about 12–16 grams of sugar. This is considerably more than the 6–9 grams of sugar found in a medium apple.</p>
<p>If you choose to eat sugarcane, try to pair it with foods low in carbohydrates, such as leafy green vegetables. This may help prevent a large spike in your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Overall, sugarcane can be a part of a healthy diabetes diet. However, be sure to monitor your blood sugar levels after eating it. If you find it’s causing large spikes in your levels, then try reducing the amount you eat.</p>
