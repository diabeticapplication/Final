       Can Diabetic Patient Eat Makhana
    </h1>
<p>Many diabetics are aware that certain food items are off bounds for them. But this need not be the case always. One such food item is makhana. Makhana is a type of water snack obtained from the pods of Euryale Ferox, which is also known as Fox Nut or Lotus seed. It is a starchy food item made from roasted mung beans or roasted fox nuts.</p>
<p>When it comes to diabetics and makhana, it is a great food item. Makhana contains very less calories and no fat. It is also an excellent source of vitamins and minerals such as magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and iron. It also contains essential amino acids and is high in fiber content, which helps with digestion and keeps blood sugar levels in control.</p>
<p>When choosing to consume makhana as a snack, it is important to keep portion size in check. Over consumption will increase blood sugar levels, driving diabetics away from their goal. With a portion size between 10-15 pieces, one can enjoy their makhana guilt-free.</p>
<p>A diabetic patient can opt for makhana in various forms. It can be enjoyed as a snack or added to various dishes to get its benefits.Makhana can be used as a snack substitute in salads, kheer or custards. Diabetics who enjoy makhana as their snack of choice will benefit from the low-glycemic index it possesses. Studies suggest that even for diabetics, consuming high-fiber containing foods can lead to a boost in glucose metabolism. This keeps sugar levels in check, ensuring a diabetic’s overall health.</p>
<p>Another point to consider when talking about makhana is its accessibility. Many meals served today have high sugar content, greatly increasing a diabetic patient’s risk. Makhana is a snack readily available to anyone with a sweet tooth; making it a better substitute. With no added flavors or sugars, one can snack on makhana for taste, while maintaining diabetes management.</p>
<p>In conclusion, makhana is a snack that can be enjoyed by diabetics. With its high fiber and low calorie content, it is a beneficial snack in maintaining sugar levels. Not only can it be enjoyed as a snack but also incorporated into various dishes. Portion size is important to keep a check on. With this knowledge, diabetics can include makhana in their diet without the fear of their sugar levels soaring.</p>
