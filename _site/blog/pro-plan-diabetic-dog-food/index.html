<p>Pro Plan Diabetic Dog Food is specifically formulated to meet the nutritional needs of dogs with diabetes. It contains a balanced blend of high-quality ingredients that help to regulate blood sugar levels and promote overall health.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Pro Plan Diabetic Dog Food is its low glycemic index.
