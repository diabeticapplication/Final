    <h1>
       Glycemic Index Of Suji
    </h1>
<p>Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how quickly carbohydrates in food raise blood sugar levels. Suji, or semolina flour, has a GI of 70, which is considered to be high on the GI scale. Eating foods with a high GI can cause a rapid rise in blood sugar levels, which can have negative health impacts. To reduce the effects of a high GI, it is recommended to combine suji with other low GI foods such as vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Additionally, it is beneficial to consume suji in moderate amounts as part of a balanced diet and to include healthy fats and proteins. This will help to keep blood sugar levels more stable and reduce the risk of health complications.</p>
<p>In comparison, Oats, barley and quinoa, all have a low GI value. Oats have the lowest GI of all, with a value of 55. Barley and quinoa, on the other hand, have a slightly higher GI of around 70. Suji is the highest of the four, with a GI of around 80. All these foods are great sources of complex carbohydrates and can be included in a healthy diet. However, oats should be consumed more often than the other grains due to its lower GI value.</p>
<p>Diabetics must be careful when consuming suji as it can cause several side effects. The most common side effects include increased risk of heart attack, higher blood pressure, kidney damage, vision problems, and weight gain. Eating suji can also cause a spike in blood sugar levels, leading to an increase in insulin levels. This can result in fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Furthermore, suji can also aggravate existing diabetic conditions or cause new ones, such as nerve damage and diabetic retinopathy. Diabetics should take caution and consult with their healthcare provider before consuming suji.</p>
