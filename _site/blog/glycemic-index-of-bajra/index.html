       Glycemic Index Of Bajra
    </h1>
<p>Bajra is a type of millet and is known for its high glycemic index. Glycemic index is the measurement of carbohydrates in food which affects the blood sugar levels. Bajra has a glycemic index of 72, which is higher than other grains such as wheat and rice. It is best consumed in moderation as its high glycemic index can cause spikes in blood sugar levels. Bajra is a great source of minerals and vitamins and provides a great deal of dietary fiber. It is also a great source of plant-based proteins. Therefore, bajra can be a great addition to a balanced diet.</p>
<p>Bajra, also known as pearl millet, has a glycemic index value of 71, which is considered high compared to other millets. Kodo millet has a glycemic index value of 54, foxtail millet has a glycemic index value of 72 and proso millet has a glycemic index value of 66. The glycemic index value of bajra is higher than that of other millets.</p>
<p>It is recommended that diabetics include bajra in their diet in moderate amounts. An ideal serving size for diabetics is 25-50g of bajra per day, which can be included as part of a balanced meal. Eating bajra in excess may lead to an unexpected spike in blood sugar levels and should be avoided. Persons with diabetes should include other low glycemic index grains such as oats, wheat, barley, ragi, etc., in their diet as well to ensure a balanced diet.</p>
