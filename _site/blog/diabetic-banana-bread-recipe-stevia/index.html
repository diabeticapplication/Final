       Diabetic Banana Bread Recipe Stevia
    </h1>
<p>If you're a diabetic or trying to cut back on sugar, finding delicious and healthy alternatives to your favorite treats can be a challenge. But fear not, because we have the perfect solution for you - a diabetic-friendly banana bread recipe sweetened with stevia!</p>
<p>Banana bread is a classic comfort food that many of us grew up enjoying. However, traditional recipes are often loaded with sugar and unhealthy fats, making them a no-go for those with diabetes or anyone trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. But with the help of stevia, a natural sweetener derived from the stevia plant, you can still indulge in this beloved treat without compromising your health.</p>
<p>To make this diabetic banana bread, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
<li>1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
<li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon allspice</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon cloves</li>
<li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a loaf pan. In a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas, applesauce, coconut oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix well until everything is well combined.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense and tough bread.</p>
<p>If desired, fold in the chopped walnuts for added texture and flavor. Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for approximately 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
<p>Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and enjoy!</p>
<p>This diabetic banana bread recipe sweetened with stevia is a guilt-free treat that you can enjoy any time of the day. It's moist, flavorful, and packed with the natural sweetness</p>
