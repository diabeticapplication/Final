       Is Wood Apple Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>The wood apple or Bael, belonging to the family of Moraceae is one of the most popular fruit in Southeast Asia and India. It is as revered for its health benefits as for its peculiar taste. People in many parts of the world have used Wood Apple for diabetes due to its ability to regulate and stabilize blood sugar.</p>
<p>The wood apple is packed with minerals, vitamins, and fiber, which make it especially effective in controlling diabetes. The wood apple has 15 to 20% of natural sugar which is ideal for diabetics. In addition, it also contains polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins which are known to reduce the risk of diabetes and regulate blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>The fruit is low in calories and also low in glycemic index which further makes it a great choice for diabetics. Studies have revealed that wood apple is useful for controlling glucose levels, reducing inflammation, and preventing complications associated with diabetes. This is due to the presence of quercetin, tannin and ellagic acid, which are three vital components known to help in controlling diabetes.</p>
<p>Wood apple is not only great for diabetics, it is an excellent source of dietary fiber and minerals which help in improving overall health. Fiber helps stabilize blood sugar levels by gradual digestion of carbohydrates. The minerals found in wood apple, such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and zinc are also essential for the overall health of the body and regulating metabolism.</p>
<p>The antioxidants present in the Bael fruit are also beneficial as they help in reducing oxidative stress and prevent cell damage. This, in turn, is helpful in reducing the risk of diabetic complications like heart diseases.</p>
<p>Besides, its juice is known to be effective in treating constipation and other digestive problems. All these amazing benefits of wood apple make it an ideal fruit for diabetes.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that daily intake of wood apple is recommended in order to get maximum benefits. Moreover, it is also essential to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly and consult a doctor to determine the right dosage</p>
<p>In conclusion, Wood apple, or Bael, is an excellent fruit for diabetics. It is low in calories, low glycemic index, and loaded with antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins which are beneficial in controlling and regulating diabetes naturally. Hence, it is always recommended to include this fruit in the daily diet for diabetics.</p>
