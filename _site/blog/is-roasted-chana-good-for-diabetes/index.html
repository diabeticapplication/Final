       Is Roasted Chana Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Gone are the days when diabetics used to stay away from roasted chana. With more research and awareness, people have started to understand how healthy chanas can be for their diabetes despite its high carbohydrate content. Roasted chana, especially, is becoming a popular snack amongst diabetics.</p>
<p>When it comes to diabetes, one should focus on the quality of the food and not its quantity. Roasted Chana or Chana dal is one such snack which is low in fat and high in proteins and minerals. This makes it a great snacking option for diabetics. According to the American Diabetes Association, it is recommended that the carbohydrates should be balanced, so including chickpeas in the diet can fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Chickpeas are loaded with important nutrients like fiber and protein. These nutrients help to improve the way the body digests starches, which can help reduce glucose levels. Eating roasted chana also helps to prevent sudden spikes in your sugar levels. According to studies, the type of carbohydrates found in chickpeas, can also help reduce bad cholesterol levels as well.</p>
<p>Apart from its many health benefits, roasted chana is also a great snack for diabetics as it is rich in fiber. Fibers help to slow down the digestion process, which can regulate blood sugar levels. Chana dal is also low in calories when compared to starchy snacks such as chips, pakoras, and samosas.</p>
<p>In addition, roasted chana contains folate and magnesium which are two important minerals for diabetic health. Folate helps in breaking carbohydrates into glucose, while magnesium is important in regulating the glucose-insulin balance in the body.</p>
<p>However, it is advisable for diabetics to limit their intake of roasted chana and other pulses because of their high carbohydrate content. Also, it is important to avoid roasting the chana in excessive oil, as this can increase the number of calories in the snack.</p>
<p>In conclusion, roasted chana can be an excellent snacking option for diabetics if it is consumed in moderation. Although it contains carbohydrates, it is also very rich in essential minerals, vitamins and fiber. Eating roasted chana will help to steady blood sugar levels and even reduce bad cholesterol levels in the body. Therefore, with the right kind of diet and physical activity, diabetics can easily enjoy roasted chana without worrying about their sugar levels.</p>
