       Can We Eat Jaggery In Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Jaggery is a traditional and widely used natural sweetener, popularly known as gur, in India and other parts of the world. It has a unique flavor and color that differs depending on the source of the sugar cane juice used to make it. Jaggery is widely used in Indian households for sweetening different kinds of dishes, especially for celebrations and festivities.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body is either unable to produce insulin or has difficulty in processing it properly. Uncontrolled diabetes can have serious health complications, so it is very important to be careful about food consumption and other lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>There is a long-existing doubt in the minds of diabetics as to whether they can include jaggery in their diets or not. Well, the good news is that yes, jaggery can be consumed in a moderate amount by diabetics. It is important to remember that all the forms of sugar should be consumed in limited quantities to prevent serious health risks associated with diabetes.</p>
<p>Jaggery is made of raw cane sugar or date sap and has a lot of nutritional benefits that no other sugar can provide. It is a natural source of iron and many other nutrients, plus it is not bleached or processed with chemicals. It is naturally rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. Therefore, it is good for overall health, if consumed in moderation.</p>
<p>The glycaemic index of jaggery is significantly lower than that of sugar. The glycaemic index (GI) is the measure of a food's effect on your blood sugar levels. Low GI foods release sugar into your bloodstream slowly and should be preferred more than foods with a high GI, as they cause sudden spikes in your blood sugar levels. Since jaggery has a low GI, it helps to maintain the blood glucose levels more effectively.</p>
<p>However, one should always keep in mind that, despite all the beneficial elements, jaggery still contains sugar and should be consumed in moderation to avoid raising your blood sugar levels and leading to a diabetic coma. Therefore, one should monitor how much they consume and ate jaggery in their diets.</p>
<p>In summary, diabetics can consume jaggery in limited amounts within the dietary recommended amounts, as it is a natural source of minerals, an antioxidant and has a low Glycaemic Index. However, an overly high quantity of jaggery should be avoided, as it can cause spikes in sugar levels and other health complications.</p>
