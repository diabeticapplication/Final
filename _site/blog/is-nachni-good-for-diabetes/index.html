       Is Nachni Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Nachni, also known as ragi or finger millet, is becoming increasingly popular in India as a nutritious and healthy food choice. It’s gaining prominence, especially among individuals with diabetes, due to its low glycaemic index and high fibre content. In fact, studies have suggested that nachni may reduce certain ,or markers of diabetes, like fasting blood glucose and haemoglobin A1c.</p>
<p>When it comes to diabetes, many individuals assume that carbohydrates should be avoided as much as possible. This is usually true, since most carbohydrates are quickly digested and absorbed, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. But, this is not the case with nachni. As a low glycaemic index food, nachni enables slow digestion and absorption, thereby preventing sudden increases in blood glucose levels post meals. Studies have also found that consuming nachni over several months can lead to significant reductions in fasting blood glucose and haemoglobin A1c levels.</p>
<p>A primary benefit of nachni is its high fibre content. Fibre helps slow the absorption of carbohydrates, thus preventing rises in blood sugar. It also helps keep you full for longer, reducing the urge to snack through the day, and carries several other health benefits. Nachni is also rich in several other micronutrients, such as folate, vitamin B6, phosphorus, zinc, copper and potassium. It is also a good source of protein, similar to whole wheat flour. This makes nachni an ideal food choice for people with diabetes, as it enables one to control glycaemic levels, while still covering other nutrient needs.</p>
<p>Incorporating nachni can be easy. It can be included in one’s diet in the form of rotis, dosa, idli, upma, dosas or even as porridge or a flour supplement. To make nachni more palatable, one can add uncooked peanuts, sesame or curry leaves to the flour. Nachni can also be enjoyed as a snack along with vegetables like carrot and beetroot.</p>
<p>In conclusion, nachni is a healthy and nutritious food choice, especially for individuals with diabetes. With its low glycaemic index and high fibre content, it offers several benefits, like blood sugar control and improved nutrient intake. Incorporating nachni in one’s diet is easy and can be done in several delicious ways. All in all, nachni is a great food choice for anyone, but especially for people with diabetes.</p>
