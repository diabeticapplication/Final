       Medicare Diabetic Shoes Form
    </h1>
<p>If you or a loved one has diabetes, you may be familiar with the Medicare Diabetic Shoes Form. This form is an essential part of the process for obtaining diabetic shoes through Medicare, a federal health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as certain younger individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>Diabetic shoes are specially designed footwear that provide extra support and cushioning to help prevent foot complications in individuals with diabetes. These complications can include foot ulcers, infections, and even amputations. Medicare recognizes the importance of diabetic shoes in preventing these complications and covers the cost of one pair of shoes and three pairs of inserts per year for eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<p>To obtain diabetic shoes through Medicare, you must first have a prescription from your doctor. Your doctor will need to fill out the Medicare Diabetic Shoes Form, also known as the Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN) form. This form includes information about your medical condition, such as your diagnosis, foot deformities, and any previous foot ulcers or amputations.</p>
<p>Once the form is completed, it must be submitted to a Medicare-approved supplier of diabetic shoes. The supplier will then verify your eligibility and work with you to select the appropriate shoes and inserts. Medicare will cover 80% of the cost, and you will be responsible for the remaining 20% as well as any deductible or coinsurance.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all suppliers accept Medicare assignment, which means they may charge more than the Medicare-approved amount. To ensure you receive the maximum coverage, it is recommended to choose a supplier that accepts Medicare assignment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Medicare Diabetic Shoes Form is a crucial document in the process of obtaining diabetic shoes through Medicare. By following the necessary steps and working with a Medicare-approved supplier, you can ensure that you or your loved one receives the necessary footwear to prevent foot complications and maintain optimal foot health.</p>
