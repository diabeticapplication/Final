<p>Diabetes Meaning In Urdu</p>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the body's inability to produce or effectively use insulin. In Urdu, diabetes is known as &quot;شوگر&quot; (Shoogar).</p>
<p>The word &quot;شوگر&quot; (Shoogar) is derived from the Arabic word &quot;سكر&quot; (Sukkar), which means sugar. This is because diabetes is primarily associated with elevated levels of sugar in the blood. In Urdu, the term &quot;شوگر&quot; (Shoogar) is commonly used to refer to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This results in a complete lack of insulin production, leading to high blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes and usually develops in childhood or adolescence.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or fails to produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. This type of diabetes is more prevalent and is often associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor dietary choices.</p>
<p>In Urdu, type 1 diabetes is referred to as &quot;شوگر کی بیماری&quot; (Shoogar ki bimari), which translates to &quot;disease of diabetes.&quot; Type 2 diabetes is known as &quot;شوگر کی بیماری کا دوسرا قسم&quot; (Shoogar ki bimari ka doosra qisam), meaning &quot;the second type of diabetes disease.&quot;</p>
<p>Diabetes is a serious condition that requires lifelong management. If left untreated or poorly controlled, it can lead to various complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels regularly, follow a healthy diet, engage in regular physical activity, and take prescribed medications or insulin as directed by their healthcare provider.</p>
<p>In Urdu, the term &quot;شوگر کی بیماری کا علاج&quot; (Shoogar ki bimari ka ilaj)</p>
