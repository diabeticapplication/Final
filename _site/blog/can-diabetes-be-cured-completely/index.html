       Can Diabetes Be Cured Completely
    </h1>
<p>Diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions globally and is increasing at an alarming rate. According to the World Health Organization, there are currently over 463 million people living with Diabetes, and this is predicted to rise to 700 million by 2045.</p>
<p>The type of diabetes known as type 1 diabetes can at times be cured but is considered irreversible in most cases. This type of diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks healthy cells in the pancreas and destroys the organ's ability to produce insulin. Without insulin, your body is unable to use sugar for fuel, which leads to dangerously high levels of blood sugar. Currently, there is no cure for type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>But what about type 2 diabetes? While this is the most common type of diabetes, it has become increasingly treatable through lifestyle changes, medications, and other interventions. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body develops a resistance to insulin and can no longer effectively use the hormone. While there is no clear-cut answer as to whether type 2 diabetes can be cured altogether, research suggests that it is possible to put type 2 diabetes in remission.</p>
<p>Remission of type 2 diabetes is when blood sugar levels are brought down to a very low or normal range, allowing individuals to manage their diabetes without medications. A study published in The Lancet: Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology found that through lifestyle changes such as following a Mediterranean diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercise, individuals with type 2 diabetes were able to significantly reduce their blood sugar levels and put diabetes into remission.</p>
<p>Some studies suggest that individuals who are able to put their diabetes into remission can remain diabetes-free for up to five years. However, it's important to note that it's not a cure, and it's a process that needs to be maintained. Those who attempt to get their blood sugar levels back in the normal range must stay committed to their lifestyle changes to maintain protection against complications of diabetes.</p>
<p>To sum it up, while there is currently no cure for type 1 diabetes, remission of type 2 diabetes is possible. Through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, individuals with type 2 diabetes can put their diabetes into remission and decrease their risk of complications from the disease. However, it is important to note that in order to remain diabetes-free, individuals must remain committed to their lifestyle changes.</p>
