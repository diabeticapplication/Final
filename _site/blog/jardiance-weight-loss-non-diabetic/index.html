       Jardiance Weight Loss Non Diabetic
    </h1>
<p>Jardiance is a medication that is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes. However, it has also been found to have an interesting side effect â€“ weight loss. This has led to its off-label use as a weight loss aid in individuals who are not diabetic.</p>
<p>Jardiance works by inhibiting a protein called SGLT2, which is responsible for reabsorbing glucose in the kidneys. By blocking this protein, Jardiance allows excess glucose to be excreted in the urine, leading to lower blood sugar levels. This mechanism of action also has the added benefit of promoting weight loss.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that Jardiance can lead to significant weight loss in non-diabetic individuals. In a clinical trial, participants who took Jardiance lost an average of 4-5% of their body weight over a period of 6 months. This weight loss was sustained over a longer period of time, with participants maintaining an average weight loss of 3-4% after 1 year.</p>
<p>The weight loss effects of Jardiance are thought to be due to a combination of factors. Firstly, the excretion of glucose in the urine leads to a decrease in calorie intake, as glucose is a source of energy. Secondly, Jardiance has been shown to reduce appetite and increase feelings of fullness, leading to a decrease in food intake. Lastly, Jardiance may also increase the body's ability to burn fat, further contributing to weight loss.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Jardiance should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. While it may be effective for weight loss in non-diabetic individuals, it is primarily intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, Jardiance may have side effects and interactions with other medications, so it is important to discuss its use with a healthcare provider.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Jardiance has shown promise as a weight loss aid in non-diabetic individuals. Its ability to lower blood sugar levels and promote weight loss makes it an attractive option for those looking to shed a few pounds. However, it is important to use Jardiance under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure its safe and effective use.</p>
