       Can Diabetic Patient Eat Curd
    </h1>
<p>Curd is a popular form of food that is widely consumed across the world. It is full of nutrients and is a part of the traditional Indian diet. There are lots of health benefits associated with it as well. But the big question that arises is whether a diabetic patient can eat curd or not.</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but there are some guidelines to follow. Generally, low-fat curds can be consumed by diabetic patients since it is low in calories and fat. However, if the diabetic patient is on any medication that lowers blood sugar, then the consumption must be avoided. Also, if the patient has high cholesterol or has elevated triglyceride levels, then avoid curd altogether.</p>
<p>Curd is beneficial for diabetic patients as it is rich in protein and contains no sugar. It is also a natural probiotic and helps improve digestion and promotes healthy gut bacteria. However, one must have a modest portion of curd. Since curd is made up of milk solids, it does contain some carbohydrates. So, one must have a moderate portion to manage blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Moreover, it contains several minerals like potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium that are vital for good health. It also contains various vitamins such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin D. All of these help boost metabolism and help treat secondary diseases associated with diabetes such as lymphedema and constipation.</p>
<p>However, even though curd is beneficial for diabetics, they must be mindful of the quantity they are consuming. It is essential to pay attention to the ingredients while buying curd. Avoid curds that contain added sugar and artificial sweeteners. Also, always buy the low-fat variety and avoid full-fat curds as they contain more calories and fat.</p>
<p>In conclusion, diabetic patients can definitely benefit from the nutrition present in curd if they have it in the right quantity. However, if you are on any medication that lowers blood sugar, then curd should be avoided altogether. Moreover, one should always choose the low-fat variety so that they donâ€™t take in too much calories and fat. A moderate portion of curd is recommended for a diabetic patient who wants to maintain good health.</p>
