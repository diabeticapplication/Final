       Can A Diabetic Person Donate Blood In India
    </h1>
<p>In India, people with diabetes can donate blood and are no different than those who are non-diabetics. However, there are certain criteria to be met before a diabetic can donate blood.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder and people with diabetes often have a low hematocrit, or the ratio of red blood cells to the total volume of blood. Hence they are required to meet several criteria before they can donate blood in India.</p>
<p>The criteria that someone with diabetes must meet before they can donate blood in India includes:</p>
<p>• The person must have been diagnosed with diabetes at least 1 year prior to the blood donation.</p>
<p>• Their average blood sugar level must be in the normal range within three months of the donation.</p>
<p>• Their haemoglobin level must not be lower than 12.5gm/L.</p>
<p>• Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels must not exceed 130mg/dl.</p>
<p>• The person must not have a history of behavioural disorders or any other co-morbid conditions.</p>
<p>• They must be free from all active infections and medical conditions.</p>
<p>The logic behind this criteria is that those who have had diabetes for at least a year are most likely to have their blood sugar levels in the normal range. This ensures that their blood is free from any diabetic complications. Furthermore, the requirement of a higher haemoglobin lets the doctor ensure that the person is fit to donate blood.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that those suffering from diabetes should not donate blood after a recent course of steroids or antibiotics as this can adversely affect the safety of the blood.</p>
<p>Ultimately, those with diabetes can donate blood in India provided they meet the criteria. It is important to keep in mind the advice of the healthcare professional before donating.</p>
<p>Finally, those with diabetes should also make sure to keep their blood sugar levels in check. This will make sure that they remain fit and healthy enough to donate blood and even donate more frequently. After all, donating blood not only saves lives but makes a big difference to those who are in need.</p>
