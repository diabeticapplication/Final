       Diabetic Biscuits Recipe
    </h1>
<p>If you or a loved one has diabetes, you know how challenging it can be to find delicious treats that won't spike blood sugar levels. But fear not, because today we're sharing a fantastic diabetic biscuits recipe that will satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising your health.</p>
<p>These biscuits are made with a few simple ingredients that are low in sugar and high in fiber. The star of the show is almond flour, which is a great alternative to regular flour for those with diabetes. Almond flour is low in carbohydrates and high in healthy fats, making it an excellent choice for managing blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>To make these biscuits, you'll need 2 cups of almond flour, 1/4 cup of coconut flour, 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, 2 tablespoons of melted coconut oil, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. You can also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for extra flavor.</p>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>
<p>Next, add the melted coconut oil, unsweetened applesauce, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, you can add a tablespoon of almond milk to help bind it together.</p>
<p>Once the dough is ready, use your hands to shape it into small biscuits. Place them on the prepared baking sheet and flatten them slightly with the palm of your hand. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown.</p>
<p>These diabetic biscuits are not only delicious but also a healthier alternative to traditional biscuits. They are packed with nutrients, low in sugar, and won't cause a sudden spike in blood sugar levels. Enjoy them as a snack or pair them with a cup of tea for a guilt-free treat.</p>
