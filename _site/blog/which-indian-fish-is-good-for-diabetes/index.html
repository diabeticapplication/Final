       Which Indian Fish Is Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Indian fish are generally very healthy and a great source of protein for those struggling with diabetes. They are also generally low in calories and fat, making them an ideal choice to incorporate into a diabetes-friendly diet. When choosing Indian fish for diabetes, some of the best options include pomfret, sole, hilsa and mackerel. In this blog, we'll take a look at what makes these fish great for diabetics, and how they can be cooked.</p>
<p>Pomfret is a type of flatfish which is rich in healthy oils, making it an ideal source of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids have been found to help reduce insulin resistance, improve triglyceride levels and help with glucose control. The fish can be lightly steamed with a bit of olive oil, lemon, garlic, and herbs, or baked in a foil packet with a variety of spices.</p>
<p>Sole is another type of flatfish that is full of flavor and low in fat and calories. Diabetics looking to get their omega-3 fatty acids will find soles are an ideal source as they are full of healthy polyunsaturated lipids. Soles can be cooked in a variety of different ways including grilling, saut√©ing, roasting, or baking.</p>
<p>Another type of Indian fish that is good for diabetes is the hilsa. This fish is low in cholesterol and is packed with omega-3 fatty acids. Hilsa can be used in curries and stir-fries, or even cooked in a tandoor oven for an interesting flavor. It can also be lightly steamed in a foil packet with some orange juice, olive oil, pepper, salt, and rosemary.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have mackerel as a great option for diabetics looking for a low-calorie, low-fat and healthy fish. Mackerel is full of omega-3 fatty acids and protein, making it an ideal source of nutrients for diabetics. Mackerel can be steamed, griddled, or grilled and combined with a variety of spices for great flavor.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Indian fish are great for diabetics, as they offer a variety of health benefits, low fat and calories and provide a great source of protein. Fish like pomfret, sole, hilsa, and mackerel are all excellent options for those looking to incorporate healthy fish into their diabetes-friendly diet. With a bit of creativity, these fish can be cooked in a variety of delicious ways to provide some tasty and healthy meals.</p>
