It allows them to have a hot and nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of a long day, without the need for extensive preparation or monitoring. Additionally, slow cooking can help to reduce the risk of overcooking or burning food, making it a safer option for those who may have difficulty standing for long periods or have limited mobility.</p>
