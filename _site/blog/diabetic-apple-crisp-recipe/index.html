       Diabetic Apple Crisp Recipe
    </h1>
<p>If you're a diabetic or have someone in your family who is, you know how challenging it can be to find delicious desserts that won't spike blood sugar levels. But fear not, because we have the perfect solution for you - a diabetic-friendly apple crisp recipe!</p>
<p>Apple crisp is a classic dessert that is loved by many, and with a few simple tweaks, it can be made diabetes-friendly without sacrificing taste. The key is to use low glycemic index ingredients and natural sweeteners.</p>
<p>To start, you'll need 4-5 medium-sized apples. Opt for varieties like Granny Smith or Pink Lady, as they have a lower sugar content. Peel and slice the apples, then toss them with a tablespoon of lemon juice to prevent browning.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of rolled oats, 1/4 cup of almond flour, 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly combined.</p>
<p>Spread the apple slices in a baking dish and sprinkle the oat mixture on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 350Â°F for about 30-35 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown.</p>
<p>This diabetic apple crisp is not only delicious but also packed with fiber and healthy fats. The natural sweetness from the apples and a touch of cinnamon will satisfy your sweet tooth without causing a spike in blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Serve it warm with a dollop of sugar-free whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla frozen yogurt for an extra treat. This recipe is perfect for any occasion, whether it's a family gathering or a cozy night in.</p>
<p>So, if you're looking for a guilt-free dessert option that won't mess with your blood sugar levels, give this diabetic apple crisp recipe a try. You won't be disappointed!</p>
