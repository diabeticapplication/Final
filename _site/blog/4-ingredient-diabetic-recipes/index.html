This smoothie is not only delicious but also provides a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats.</p>
<p>For a satisfying dinner option, try making a lemon garlic salmon. Simply marinate a salmon fillet in a mixture of lemon juice, minced garlic, and olive oil for about 30 minutes. Then, bake it in the oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. This flavorful dish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and protein, making it a great choice for a heart-healthy meal.</p>
