       Diabetic Apple Crumble With Oats
    </h1>
<p>If you're a diabetic or trying to watch your sugar intake, finding delicious desserts that won't spike your blood sugar levels can be a challenge. But fear not, because we have the perfect solution for you - Diabetic Apple Crumble with Oats!</p>
<p>This mouthwatering dessert is not only low in sugar, but it's also packed with fiber and nutrients from the oats and apples. Oats are a great source of soluble fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar levels and keeps you feeling full for longer. Apples, on the other hand, are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, making them a healthy choice for any dessert.</p>
<p>To make this diabetic-friendly apple crumble, start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a bowl, mix together 4 cups of peeled and sliced apples, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 cup of sugar substitute (such as stevia or erythritol). Transfer the apple mixture to a baking dish.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of rolled oats, 1/4 cup of almond flour, 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, 1/4 cup of sugar substitute, and a pinch of salt. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and crumbly. Sprinkle the oat mixture evenly over the apples.</p>
<p>Bake the crumble in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown. Allow it to cool slightly before serving.</p>
<p>This diabetic apple crumble with oats is the perfect guilt-free dessert for those with diabetes or anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional apple crumble. It's sweet, crunchy, and full of flavor, without the added sugar. So go ahead, indulge in this delicious treat without worrying about your blood sugar levels!</p>
