       Diabetic Lemon Pie
    </h1>
<p>If you're a fan of lemon desserts but have to watch your sugar intake due to diabetes, then this Diabetic Lemon Pie recipe is perfect for you! This delicious and tangy pie is made with a few simple ingredients that won't spike your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>To start, you'll need a pre-made pie crust or you can make your own using a sugar substitute. For the filling, you'll need fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, eggs, sugar substitute, and cornstarch. The sugar substitute can be any brand that is suitable for baking and doesn't contain any added sugars.</p>
<p>To make the filling, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, eggs, sugar substitute, and cornstarch in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens. Once thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

<p>When it's time to serve, slice the pie into wedges and enjoy the refreshing and zesty flavors of this Diabetic Lemon Pie. The tartness of the lemons combined with the sweetness of the sugar substitute creates a perfect balance that will satisfy your dessert cravings without causing a spike in your blood sugar levels.</p>
