       Poha Glycemic Index
    </h1>
<p>Poha or Flattened Rice is a staple food of India and is known to be a healthy and balanced diet. It has a low Glycemic Index (GI). GI is a rating system that is used to measure how quickly carbohydrates are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. It is important for people with diabetes to watch their blood sugar levels and Poha is an ideal food choice since it has a low GI index. Poha also has a low fat content and is a good source of carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It is considered to be a healthy breakfast option, as it can help to control hunger and keep blood sugar levels stable.</p>
<p>Poha is a popular food item in India and has a low glycemic index value of 55. This makes it an ideal food item for people with diabetes or those looking to control their blood sugar levels. Comparatively, the glycemic index value of white rice is 72 and that of whole wheat bread is 69. Moreover, processed snacks such as chips and sugar-sweetened beverages have a glycemic index value of over 70. Therefore, as compared to other food items, poha is a healthier option with its lower glycemic index value.</p>
<p>However, there are several alternatives available for diabetics, which are based on GI, such as Oats, Ragi, and Sabudana. Oats are a great source of dietary fibre and contain low GI value. Ragi or Finger Millet is also a great option, as it is rich in calcium and is known to lower the risk of diabetes. Sabudana or Tapioca is also a low GI food and can be consumed in moderate amounts. All the aforementioned options are healthy alternatives for diabetics who want to enjoy a variety of dishes.</p>
