       Is Dried Apricot Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>When previously thought to be a health hazard, dried apricots are actually effective in balancing the blood sugar level in the body of individuals suffering from diabetes, specifically when taken in moderate amounts and coupled with proper diet and exercise. Many scientific studies have also suggested that the dried fruit can help in controlling insulin resistance, which is a defining feature of Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>First of all, one of the primary things to consider before including any food item in your diet is its glycemic index. Glycemic index or GI measures the ability of a food item to raise blood sugar levels. A score of 55 or less is considered to be low on the glycemic index scale and dried apricots, with a score of 31, fall true to this principle. This low GI means that dried apricots do not cause a surge in blood sugar levels as observed in other fruits like bananas or mangoes. The carbohydrate content of apricots is also much lower than other fruits, providing just about 8.3 grams per 100-gram serving. All these factors combine to make dried apricots a healthy snack for those with diabetes.</p>
<p>Further research has demonstrated that dried apricots are filled with antioxidants and vitamin A, both of which have a powerful effect on controlling diabetes. Vitamin A helps in controlling both insulin production and action, leading to better blood sugar management. Similarly, antioxidants help regulate and maintain the cells in our body to work their best, all of which leads to better insulin balance.</p>
<p>Eating dried apricots is a great way to ensure that you get your daily dosage of dietary fiber. Fiber helps in numerous ways, be it better digestion, removal of toxins from the body or even preventing constipation. When it comes to diabetes specifically, it helps in improving the sensitivity of our body to insulin as well as lowering the cholesterol levels present in our body. A 100-gram serving of dried apricots comes with 6.7 grams of dietary fiber, making it a great snack on the go.</p>
<p>Even though eating dried apricots is an excellent way to control your blood sugar levels, it should be done only in moderation. Too much of anything is never good for our health and the same applies to dried apricots as well. A serving of about 10 apricots or 50 grams per day is the ideal amount for an individual suffering from diabetes. Eating more than that can cause an increment in the number of carbohydrates being consumed and lead to other health issues.</p>
<p>To summarize, dried apricots are one of the best dietary options for those with diabetes. Its low GI, antioxidant richness, high dietary fiber count, and other nutritional values make it a powerful choice to keep our blood sugar levels under check. The food item should be taken in moderation to ensure that other dietary aspects such as the total amount of carbohydrates being consumed are not being neglected.</p>
