       Is Multigrain Atta Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>Gone are the days when diabetics could only rely on a bowl full of salad and fruits for their meals. Nowadays, diabetics have many food options available to them and with that, comes the plethora of questions about which food to opt for. One common question that is asked often is whether multigrain atta is good for diabetics or not.</p>
<p>In order to discuss this topic, it is essential to first understand the nature of diabetes. Diabetes develops in two forms, Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 develops when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin while Type 2 is usually caused due to an unhealthy lifestyle including poor diet choices.</p>
<p>In the case of both conditions, regulating the blood sugar levels with consistent diet and lifestyle choices is very important. This is where multigrain atta can play a key role.</p>
<p>Multigrain atta contains a combination of grains such as wheat, jowar, bajra and oats. All these grains are rich in fibre that helps the body in maintaining a balanced and slow release of energy throughout the day. Whole grains like multigrain atta are also proven to help in reducing the risk of heart diseases, strokes and more. So, it can be highly beneficial for diabetes patients as well.</p>
<p>What also makes multigrain atta a great choice for diabetics is that it contains complex carbohydrates. Unlike simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates are digested and absorbed more slowly which helps in maintaining the blood sugar levels throughout the day. This, in turn, prevents sudden spikes or drops in the amount of glucose in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Moreover, adding some proteins in your multigrain atta is a great way to make it even more diabetic-friendly. To do so, you can mix a few nuts, seeds and pulses in your multigrain atta mix. You can also opt for some freshly cut veggies to add more fibre to your dish.</p>
<p>Also, as a diabetic person, it is important to think in terms of food quality rather than quantity. Consuming fewer calories that are complex carbohydrates based will help to regulate the blood sugar levels. As such, always opt for high-fibre foods like multigrain atta, oats and other complex carbohydrates to get the most benefits from your meal.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, multigrain atta can definitely be included in a diabetic personâ€™s diet on a regular basis. But, it is essential to keep an eye on the portion size since even healthy foods can be unhealthy when consumed in large quantities. Plus, for better results, always complement your multigrain atta with healthy food choices and regular physical activities.</p>
