       Is Roti Good For Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Roti, also known as chapatti, is a type of unleavened flatbread commonly eaten in India and parts of South Asia. It is very popular among people who have diabetes, and many people view it as a more healthy alternative to other types of bread.</p>
<p>Roti is made from whole wheat flour, which has a low glycemic index. This means that it is digested and absorbed more slowly, which helps to stabilise blood sugar levels. Studies have shown that eating whole grain roti can help to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and help to control diabetes in those who already have it.</p>
<p>The low carbohydrate content of roti also means that it won’t raise blood glucose levels as much as some other types of bread. This makes it a good choice for diabetics, as they need to be more careful with their carbohydrate intakes to keep their blood sugar levels stable.</p>
<p>Despite its health benefits, roti can still be high in calories and fat, so it’s important to be mindful of portion sizes. To get the most from roti, try to limit it to around 2-3 servings per day. This may mean cutting down on other types of carbohydrates such as white bread and rice.</p>
<p>Roti is also a great source of fibre. Fibre helps to slow down the rate at which food leaves the stomach, which can help to control blood sugar levels. Fibre is also thought to reduce the risk of developing diabetes-related complications such as heart disease and stroke, so aiming for at least 25g per day is recommended.</p>
<p>Overall, roti can be a great choice for people with diabetes. It is low glycemic, low carbohydrate and high in fibre, so it can help to keep blood sugar levels stable and reduce the risk of developing diabetes-related complications. However, it is still high in calories and fat, so it’s important to be mindful of portion sizes. If roti forms part of a balanced diet, it can be a great way to gain the health benefits without needing to cut out all types of bread.</p>
