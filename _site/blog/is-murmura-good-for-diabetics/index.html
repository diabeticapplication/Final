       Is Murmura Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>Millions of diabetics around the globe consume murmura or puffed rice as part of their daily diet. Murmura is a type of cereal created by processing raw rice, which in turn forms into little cylindrical shapes, puffed up to give it a light and airy texture. It has been a traditional part of Indian cuisine for centuries. But is murmura good for diabetics?</p>
<p>The answer is both yes and no. Murmura is often eaten with vegetables, spices, or as part of a savoury snack, and when consumed as part of a meal plan, it can be a healthy food choice for diabetics. This is because it is a source of complex carbohydrates, which are absorbed more slowly into the bloodstream. This helps to stabilise blood glucose levels and can prevent diabetes related complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Puffed rice is also comparatively a low-calorie food, containing just 90 calories per 100 grams, making it a good option for diabetics looking to control their weight.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits, there are some potential drawbacks to consuming murmura as part of a diet. Firstly, the process of puffing rice increases the glycaemic index of the food, meaning it can cause a sharp rise in blood sugar levels. This means it may be best to limit the amount of puffed rice you consume in one sitting, as its effect on blood sugar can be unpredictable.</p>
<p>In addition, murmura is usually sold ready-to-eat in supermarkets, and is often packed with added sugar and other additives. Itâ€™s important for diabetics to check the label of any pre-packaged food before consumption say puffed rice, as it may have considerably more calories than the plain version.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to its high fibre content, puffed rice has a low glycaemic load, which means it should be part of a balanced diet. Therefore, diabetics should opt for complex carbohydrates like those found in whole grain and unprocessed cereals that are much better for sustained and steady-state blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while murmura can be enjoyed as part of a healthy meal plan for diabetics, it is important to be mindful of the impact it can have on blood sugar. If monitored and consumed in moderation, murmura can be a part of a diabetes friendly diet.</p>
