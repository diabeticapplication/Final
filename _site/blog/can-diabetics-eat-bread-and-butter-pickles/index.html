       Can Diabetics Eat Bread And Butter Pickles
    </h1>
<p>If you are diabetic and you are wondering if bread and butter pickles are suitable for your diet, the answer is yes, but with some caveats. Bread and butter pickles are a classic condiment made with cucumbers, vinegar, sugar, and spices. They are a popular snack or accompanying condiment to many recipes and sandwiches. Since bread and butter pickles contain sugar, you must watch out for the portion size and sodium levels when you include them in your diet.</p>
<p>In general, bread and butter pickles are low in carbohydrates — about 0.9 grams per tablespoon — so they are safe to include as part of a healthy diabetes diet. The important thing to consider is that many store-bought brands of bread and butter pickles are high in sodium, which can be a concern for diabetics. In fact, one tablespoon of bread and butter pickles contains about 170 mg of sodium. Rather than use store-bought pickles, you can make your own low-sodium version at home.</p>
<p>In addition to checking the sodium levels of the pickles you buy, you should also watch your portions. For instance, if you have a sandwich with a pickle spear and a tablespoon of pickles on the side, that’s about 0.9 grams of carbohydrates, 35 calories, and 340 mg of sodium. Although this isn't too bad if you divide it up over a couple of servings, if you eat the entire sandwich in one sitting, the amount of carbohydrates and sodium can quickly add up — not to mention the calories. If you want to enjoy the flavor of bread and butter pickles without the additional calories and carbohydrates, you can make your own low-calorie version at home.</p>
<p>When you make your own bread and butter pickles, you can control the amount of sugar used and ensure that the sodium levels are within the safety limits for diabetics. When making bread and butter pickles at home, you want to use low-sodium vinegar, or else the sodium content in the finished product will be too high. You can also reduce the amount of sugar and spices used for a less sweet flavor, or even opt for low-sugar substitutes if unwanted sugar is a concern.</p>
<p>All in all, bread and butter pickles are okay to eat in moderation when you have diabetes, as long as you watch the portion size and the sugar and sodium levels. You should also make sure that you are eating a variety of healthy foods and snacks throughout the day for a balanced diet. If you are looking for a delicious, low-carbohydrate snack option while still enjoying the flavor of bread and butter pickles, then consider making your own low-sodium version with healthy replacements.</p>
