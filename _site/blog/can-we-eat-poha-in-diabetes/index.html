       Can We Eat Poha In Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>Poha, a traditional Indian breakfast, has been one of the most popular dishes in India for centuries. And while it was once deemed unhealthy, recent research has linked poha to a number of health benefits, including regulating blood sugar in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Poha (flattened rice) is the traditional choice for a nutritious and balanced Indian breakfast. It is a great source of iron, which is essential for healthy energy levels and can help reduce anemia-related fatigue. It is also full of fibre, which helps in digestion and can reduce inflammation. And, surprisingly, many studies have shown poha can even lower blood sugar in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Rich with Carbohydrates</p>
<p>Poha is high in carbohydrates and low in fat. Carbohydrates are converted to sugar in the body, so poha can raise blood sugar levels if eaten in large quantities. But moderate portions of poha can still be safely enjoyed by people with diabetes, as its soluble fibre helps to slow the absorption of sugar in the blood. Furthermore, poha is low in glycemic index which means even when consumed in moderation, it will not lead to a huge spike in blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Replacing Fat with Protein</p>
<p>To control blood sugar, people with diabetes should opt for poha recipes that contain more protein and less fat. Adding ingredients such as lean meats, fish, vegetables, and nuts can provide important nutrients and reduce the overall carbohydrate content of the dish. Alternatively, adding flaxseed powder or grated coconut can also help reduce the glycemic index of the dish.</p>
<p>Adding Extra Insulin</p>
<p>If you have diabetes and need to eat poha, it is important to adjust the dosage of insulin accordingly. Insulin is a medication used to regulate blood sugar levels, and a high-carbohydrate breakfast such as poha will require additional insulin to avoid blood sugar spikes. Before consuming poha, consult with your doctor or diabetes specialist about necessary insulin adjustments.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>While people with diabetes should exercise caution before consuming poha, this traditional breakfast is still one of the most popular choices in India. Moderation and careful adjustments to insulin dosage are essential for those with diabetes, but with the right preparation, poha can be a delicious and nutritious addition to a diabetes-friendly diet.</p>
