It also has a user-friendly interface and customizable settings, making it a great option for those new to insulin pump therapy.</p>
<p>Another top insulin pump is the Tandem t:slim X2. This pump is known for its sleek design and touchscreen interface, making it easy to use and discreet to wear. It also has integration capabilities with the Dexcom G6 CGM, allowing for seamless glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.</p>
