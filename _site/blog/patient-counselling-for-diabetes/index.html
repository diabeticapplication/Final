<p>Patient Counselling for Diabetes</p>
<p>Living with diabetes can be challenging, but with the right knowledge and support, it is possible to manage the condition effectively. Patient counselling plays a crucial role in empowering individuals with diabetes to take control of their health and make informed decisions. In this blog post, we will explore the importance of patient counselling for diabetes and discuss some key aspects that healthcare professionals should focus on during counselling sessions.</p>

Healthcare professionals should teach patients how to use a glucometer to measure their blood sugar levels accurately. They should also explain the target range for blood sugar levels and the importance of regular monitoring to identify any fluctuations or patterns.</p>
