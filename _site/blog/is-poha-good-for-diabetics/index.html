       Is Poha Good For Diabetics
    </h1>
<p>When it comes to tackling diabetes, it is no surprise that the Indian diet has many foods that are beneficial and that can be used as a part of a healthy and balanced diet. One of these is poha, a popular breakfast dish in many parts of India. But is poha actually good for diabetics? The answer is – yes!</p>
<p>Poha is made of beaten or flattened rice. It is usually served with vegetables or spices, with an optional addition of nuts and raisins. This dish is low in fat, low in sugar and very high in fiber, making it an excellent choice for diabetics who are trying to lose weight or manage their blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>In terms of nutritional benefits, poha is rich in thiamin, which helps in the conversion of carbohydrates to energy. It is also a good source of magnesium, which is important for glucose metabolism, thus helping to keep blood sugar levels stable. Additionally, poha is packed with vitamins B6 and B12. Vitamin B6 helps produce insulin and vitamin B12 helps to regulate blood sugar levels. Therefore, it is an excellent food for diabetics.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is better to consume poha without sugar and go for natural sweeteners such as honey or jaggery. It is also important to choose the right type of poha. For diabetics, avoid the heavier varieties, such as the heavy sugary kurmura poha. It is recommended to go for the lighter versions like the flattened rice, or rice flakes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to remember that, while poha is a good choice for people with diabetes, it should be eaten in moderation. It should not be consumed more than twice a week and should not be the only grain that diabetics are consuming. Additionally, for best results, poha should be paired with some foods high in proteins, such as legumes or eggs. This helps in better absorption of nutrients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, poha has some excellent health benefits and can be a great choice for diabetics. Make sure to go for the lighter varieties, avoid adding refined sugars and pair it with foods high in proteins for better absorption of nutrients. Ultimately, as with everything, moderation is key – just because poha is good for diabetics doesn't mean that it should be the only grain that they eat.</p>
