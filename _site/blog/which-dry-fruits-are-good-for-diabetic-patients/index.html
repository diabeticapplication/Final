       Which Dry Fruits Are Good For Diabetic Patients
    </h1>
<p>Dry fruits are known as a nutritious and healthy diet for any person, not just diabetics. Patients suffering from diabetes should however, include dry fruits in their diet with caution and as directed by their healthcare provider. Generally, a maximum of handful (approximately 40-50gm) should be consumed, which is equivalent to one to two dates, eight to ten pieces of raisins (Kishmish), five to seven apricot (khubani/khubani) or one tablespoon of unsalted and unroasted nuts (chilgoza, almonds).</p>
<p>Dates are one of the most nutritious dry fruits for diabetics. These are a good source of fiber, which helps in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels within a better range in diabetics. Dates are also a powerhouse of magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, and carotene, which increases immunity as well as promote proper functioning of organs.</p>
<p>Raisins, which are dried grapes, are also good for diabetics. Rich in several antioxidants including polyphenols, they help reduce the damage caused by diabetes to the eye, nerve and kidney. Fiber present in them also helps reduce blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Apricots are loaded with essential nutrients such as dietary fiber, Vitamin A, C and E. In addition to this, apricots are very low in calories and rich in antioxidants, which help reduce cholesterol and inflammation, while increasing energy. All these properties make them ideal for diabetics.</p>
<p>Almonds are high in Vitamin E, magnesium and fiber, and help reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Research also suggests that almonds can improve body weight, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels in diabetics.</p>
<p>Chilgoza nuts are also an excellent dry fruit option for diabetics. These nuts are low in calories, rich in fiber, and are loaded with essential vitamins and minerals such as Vitamin C, E, K, copper, and manganese. They're also good for the heart and assist with weight loss.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that dry fruits should always be consumed in moderation and never on an empty stomach. While adding them to your diet, make sure you consume them along with meals to help maintain healthy blood glucose levels. Diabetics should also monitor their sugar levels regularly and consult with their healthcare provider regarding any dietary changes.</p>
