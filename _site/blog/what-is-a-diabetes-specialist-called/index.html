       What Is A Diabetes Specialist Called
    </h1>
<p>A diabetes specialist, also known as an endocrinologist or a diabetes doctor, is a health care professional who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of diabetes. Endocrinologists are the most qualified health care practitioners to diagnose and treat diabetes and diabetic complications.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that requires close medical attention to prevent complications and monitor for a variety of issues, including heart and blood vessel disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye damage. Endocrinologists are experts in identifying and treating these complications and are often the first line of defense for individuals with diabetes.</p>
<p>Endocrinologists complete an extra three years in residency, in addition to the four-year residency for a medical doctor, to gain the skills and knowledge required to receive certification as a diabetes specialist. During the residency, doctors gaining specialty certification in endocrinology receive additional training, allowing them to become skilled in the detection and treatment of diabetes and related diseases.</p>
<p>The specific duties of a diabetes specialist depend upon the individual's areas of expertise. A diabetes doctor typically begins by evaluating the patient's risk factors, such as family medical history, lifestyle, physical activity levels, and current weight. With this information, a diabetes specialist can evaluate the patient’s current medical condition and develop a customized treatment plan tailored for the individual. This plan may include lifestyle changes, such as limiting the intake of certain foods, increasing physical activity levels, and maintaining a healthy weight to control blood sugar levels. The diabetes doctor may also prescribe oral medications or insulin as needed.</p>
<p>In addition, a diabetes specialist should be able to recognize the signs of diabetes-related health issues and provide guidance to the patient about how to prevent further complications. They are also responsible for establishing on-going communication with the patient’s primary physician to monitor the patient’s health and progress.</p>
<p>With proper care and close attention, individuals with diabetes can lead happy, healthy lives. Diabetes specialists are the medical professionals who possess the expertise and knowledge necessary to help patients manage this condition. Endocrinologists are the go-to source for individuals with diabetes and any concerns related to their management or care.</p>
