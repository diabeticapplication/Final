       Can We Eat Paneer In Diabetes
    </h1>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, one common question that you may have is whether or not you can still continue to eat paneer, or any cheese for that matter.</p>
<p>The answer is, yes, you can eat cheese, but it’s important to understand some of the health benefits and implications of eating cheese regularly. In most cases, eating cheese as a part of a balanced diet can be beneficial, however those with diabetes need to take care to monitor their intake of this type of food carefully.</p>
<p>Paneer is a type of cheese made by curdling heated milk with a food acid, such as vinegar or lemon juice, before pressing it into a solid state. It is a high-protein, low-calorie food that is commonly used in traditional Indian cuisine.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that not all cheeses are created equal. A lot of cheeses are high in saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol, which could potentially cause health complications for those with diabetes. However, paneer is considered to be a “good” cheese because it is so low in fat and calories. In addition, it is high in calcium, phosphorous and vitamin B12, making it a valuable source of nutrients.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the context of someone with diabetes, eating paneer can be a surprisingly healthy option. In fact, recent studies suggest that a diet containing paneer can help to control blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. It is also believed to be beneficial in reducing the risk of certain cardiac diseases in those with diabetes.</p>
<p>However, as with all types of food, it is important to practise portion control when consuming paneer. An ideal portion size of paneer for those with diabetes should include two ounces, which is equivalent to one serving of low-fat cottage cheese. Furthermore, it is important to also factor in the other ingredients that the paneer is combined with in recipes. For example, adding sugar, oil, fat and cream to recipes will reduce the health benefits of each serving.</p>
<p>Overall, while it is still possible to enjoy paneer as part of a diabetes-friendly diet, it is important to practice moderations and remain mindful of all the other ingredients that are used in recipes, as this can drastically impact the health benefits of including paneer in your diet.</p>
